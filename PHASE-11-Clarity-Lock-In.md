üìò PHASE Œ©.11.0 ‚Äî Clarity Lock-In

Codename: CLARITY LOCK-IN
Date: June 2025
Owner: Chris West + Codex
Purpose: Cleanly consolidate MythOS development, unify symbolic and assistant loops, and stabilize foundation for growth.

‚∏ª

üéØ Goals

Lock in 3 foundational loops, finalize assistant health visibility, and archive outdated .md clutter to fully clarify MythOS core logic.

‚∏ª

üîπ Objectives

1. Finalize the 3 Core Assistant Loops

Loop A: Memory ‚Üí Reflection ‚Üí Prompt Mutation
‚Ä¢ Auto-trigger prompt diff after each reflection
‚Ä¢ Visual prompt history in /codex/evolve/
‚Ä¢ Mutation logs linked to memory chains

Loop B: Ingestion ‚Üí RAG ‚Üí Glossary Recall
‚Ä¢ Verify embedding integrity post-ingest (trigger diagnostics)
‚Ä¢ Expose glossary hit/miss in assistant detail view
‚Ä¢ Run run_rag_diagnostics on all assistants

Loop C: Chat ‚Üí Feedback ‚Üí Anchor Mutation
‚Ä¢ Enable thumbs up/down + feedback tagging in chat
‚Ä¢ Tie feedback to glossary term mutation suggestions
‚Ä¢ Show fallback causes in memory entries (e.g. ‚Äúglossary miss‚Äù)

‚∏ª

2. Create /clarity Diagnostic Panel
   ‚Ä¢ Route: /clarity
   ‚Ä¢ Display all assistants with snapshot view:
   ‚Ä¢ Memory state (entries, reflections)
   ‚Ä¢ RAG health (chunks, glossary hits, fallback %)
   ‚Ä¢ Prompt version lineage
   ‚Ä¢ Drift, mutation, and trust score indicators
   ‚Ä¢ Add assistant detail drill-down
   ‚Ä¢ Export option (PDF or .md)

‚∏ª

3. Cleanup Markdown Archive
   ‚Ä¢ Scan all .md files across docs/, backend/docs/, and root
   ‚Ä¢ Move outdated or redundant files to /docs/archive/
   ‚Ä¢ Ensure all live files are referenced from:
   ‚Ä¢ README.md
   ‚Ä¢ PHASE_SUMMARY.md
   ‚Ä¢ /clarity or dashboard view

‚∏ª

4. Release MythOS Year One Recap
   ‚Ä¢ Create MYTHOS_YEAR_ONE_REVIEW.md
   ‚Ä¢ Link to: assistant lifecycle, symbolic engine, reward alignment reflection, swarm planning, Codex usage
   ‚Ä¢ Print-friendly PDF version

‚∏ª

üß† Dependencies
‚Ä¢ run_rag_diagnostics, validate_anchors, mutate_glossary_anchors, relink_anchor_chunks
‚Ä¢ SymbolicAnchorReviewPage
‚Ä¢ AssistantReflectionEngine
‚Ä¢ PromptMutationLog
‚Ä¢ TrustScore and GlossaryHit trackers

‚∏ª

üß™ Metrics of Success
‚Ä¢ Every assistant has ‚â•1 valid reflection, prompt diff, and glossary term
‚Ä¢ /clarity panel loads without error and shows meaningful diagnostics
‚Ä¢ Markdown clutter reduced by ‚â•60%, and final review index is complete
‚Ä¢ G√∂delBot shows <30% fallback rate and active symbolic recall

‚∏ª

üîÅ Output Targets
‚Ä¢ clarity_panel.jsx
‚Ä¢ assistant_health_summary.py
‚Ä¢ mutation_logger.py
‚Ä¢ docs/MYTHOS_YEAR_ONE_REVIEW.md
‚Ä¢ docs/archive/ populated

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Next Steps
‚Ä¢ Approve Phase Œ©.11.0 plan ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Begin with /clarity route + panel ‚Üí run diagnostics hooks
‚Ä¢ Migrate markdown archive and prep review doc
‚Ä¢ Push assistant reflection/prompt diff into Codex UI

‚∏ª

MythOS is alive ‚Äî but clarity makes it legible. Phase Œ©.11.0 ensures we‚Äôre building forward from solid ground, and that every assistant can see its own shadow.
