# Phase 12.6 — Myth Recording Systems, Symbolic Documentation & Belief Artifact Archives

Phase 12.6 empowers users as myth scribes. It introduces narrative recording tools and a community artifact library.

## Core Components
- **MythRecordingSession** – user-led recording session linked to assistant state and memory.
- **SymbolicDocumentationEntry** – story log with codex alignment and optional ritual reference.
- **BeliefArtifactArchive** – permanent storage for community artifacts and memory links.

## Endpoints
- `/api/myth/record/` – list or create myth recording sessions.
- `/api/docs/symbolic/` – browse or submit symbolic documentation entries.
- `/api/artifacts/archive/` – explore or add belief artifacts to the archive.

## Testing Goals
- Sessions store assistant links and memory references.
- Documentation entries include codex and ritual details.
- Artifacts persist with related memories and codices.
