# ðŸ§  frontend/AGENTS.md â€” UI Tasks

This file tracks tasks for the React/Vite frontend. Refer to the root `AGENTS.md` for repo-wide goals and `backend/AGENTS.md` for API work.

## Next Steps

1. Build the Agent Dashboard UI in `pages/agents/AgentPage.jsx`.
   - List all agents with their names, LLMs, and execution styles.
   - Link each agent to a detail page.
   - Add filters for `execution_style` and `preferred_llm`.
2. Follow `../docs/route_sync_checklist.md` to keep routes aligned with the backend.
3. Polish dev dashboards and grouped reflection panels.
