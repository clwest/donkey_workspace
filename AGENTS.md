# ðŸ§  AGENTS.md â€” Donkey Workspace (Root)

This repository combines a Django backend and a React/Vite frontend. The root `AGENTS.md` keeps repo-wide goals. Backend and frontend specifics live in their own `AGENTS.md` files.

## ðŸ“Œ Repo-Wide Goals

- Document the overall architecture linking the backend API and the UI.
- Keep backend and frontend routes in sync.
- Add integration tests that cover end-to-end assistant flows.
- Reference the roadmaps in `backend/docs/` for longer-term plans.

## ðŸ”— Sub-Project Guides

- **Backend tasks:** `backend/AGENTS.md`
- **Frontend tasks:** `frontend/AGENTS.md`
