# 🧠 Donkey Assistant System — Status Report

_Last updated: May 9, 2025_

---

## 🚀 Assistant Bootstrapping

- ✅ Create new AI assistants directly from documents (e.g. LangChain, Solidity)
- Auto-extracts:

  - `name`, `system_prompt`, `tone`, `personality`, `specialties`

- ✅ Auto-creates:

  - Assistant Project
  - Initial Objective
  - MemoryEntry (summary-based)
  - NarrativeThread

- ✅ Auto-links:

  - Document ↔️ Assistant
  - Memory ↔️ Document
  - Thread ↔️ Memory

- ✅ Redirects with deep links: `/assistants/[slug]?thread=...&project=...&memory=...`

---

## 📂 Assistant Project Dashboard

- View assigned assistant
- Spawn new assistants
- Select & link system prompts
- Toggle **Auto-Mode**
- View:

  - Linked Prompts
  - Objectives
  - Reflections
  - Memory Chains

- 🧠 **Intelligence Panel**

  - Reflect on documents
  - Generate system prompts
  - Add thoughts or reflect manually

---

## 📄 Document Ingestion + Intelligence

- ✅ Documents can be uploaded or scraped from:

  - URLs, PDFs, Markdown, YouTube (planned)

- View document preview and metadata
- ✅ `Summarize with Context`
- ✅ `Bootstrap Assistant from Doc`
- ✅ Reflections & analysis tools being wired in

---

## 🧠 Assistant Detail Page

- View all core data:

  - Slug, Status, Specialty, Tone, Personality
  - Model (e.g. GPT-4o)

- ✅ Linked:

  - Documents
  - Projects
  - Objectives
  - Memories
  - NarrativeThreads

- Buttons:

  - Chat
  - Thoughts
  - Memory
  - Reflections
  - Sessions

- Deep linking support for memory/objective/thread context

---

## 🧠 Memory System & Narrative Threads

- ✅ MemoryEntry model captures assistant observations & summaries
- ✅ NarrativeThread model connects related entries and context
- ✅ Tags + threading = powerful memory navigation
- ✅ Entries link to Assistants, Projects, ThoughtLogs, Threads, etc.
- In progress:

  - Feedback system
  - Assistant reflection over memory chains

---

## 🛠️ Backend Capabilities

- Django REST Framework
- Model structure includes:

  - `Assistant`, `AssistantProject`, `Objective`, `PromptLink`, `MemoryEntry`
  - `NarrativeThread`, `Document`, `Tag`, `ThoughtLog`, `ReflectionLog`

- GPT-4o powered extraction, summarization, tagging
- Redis and Celery installed for task offloading
- Modular `views/intelligence.py`, `views/projects.py`, `views/assistants.py`

---

## 🧰 Frontend Infrastructure

- Built with React + Vite + Bootstrap 5
- Centralized API utils with `apiFetch`
- Clean UX:

  - Spinners, toasts, scroll-into-view logic
  - Tabbed and segmented UIs

- Pages:

  - `/assistants/[slug]`
  - `/assistants/projects/[id]`
  - `/intel/documents/[id]`
  - `/prompts/`, `/memories/`, `/reflections/`

- Fully navigable and interconnected

---

## 🧭 What’s Next?

- ✅ Make `/assistants/projects/[id]` use real AssistantProject model (done!)
- ⬜ Add feedback to memory entries
- ⬜ Add Assistant auto-reflect or plan suggestions
- ⬜ Finish Reflection Tools in Project View
- ⬜ Create/Link PromptMutation tools
- ⬜ Let agents take actions from project objectives
- ⬜ Deploy persistent Redis + Postgres infrastructure for memory sync
