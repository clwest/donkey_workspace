# 🧠 CONTINUATION — Agent System Buildout for Donkey AI

## ✅ Context Summary

We’re mid-way through building out the **Agent System** inside the Donkey AI Assistant platform. Here's what we've completed so far:

- ✅ Created the `Agent` model with fields like `name`, `slug`, `description`, `preferred_llm`, `execution_style`, and `parent_assistant`
- ✅ Added `agents/serializers.py` and `agents/views.py` using `@api_view` style like the rest of the app
- ✅ Seeded initial agents (`Donkey Bot`, `Logic Llama`, `Mystic Owl`) and connected them to their parent assistants (like Zeno)
- ✅ Created the page file `pages/agents/AgentPage.jsx` to begin rendering agents in the frontend
- ✅ Cleaned some memory to improve iteration going forward

## 🛠️ Next Objective

Start wiring up the **Agent Dashboard UI** — beginning in `AgentPage.jsx` — and render:

- Basic list of all agents
- Clickable links to detail pages
- (Later) Tools for filtering by `execution_style`, `preferred_llm`, etc.

Hey! We just finished setting up the Agent model and seeding the initial agents (Donkey Bot, Logic Llama, Mystic Owl). I’ve created `pages/agents/AgentPage.jsx` and we’re ready to build the frontend Agent Dashboard.

Let’s start wiring up the Agent UI — display a list of agents with their names, LLMs, execution styles, and linked detail views.

We’re using React + Vite + Bootstrap and keeping components modular under `/components/agents/`.

Can you give me the next step?
