# Phase Ω.5.8 — Codex Fragmentation Engine, Ritual Decomposition Planner & Swarm-Based Codification Strategies

Phase Ω.5.8 introduces a modular evolution system for the MythOS codex. Clauses can be broken into fragments, rituals are decomposed into symbolic steps, and swarm patterns are mined for new codex standards.

## Core Components
- **CodexClauseFragment** – stores individual clause fragments for targeted tagging.
- **FragmentTraceLog** – records lineage from original clause to fragment.
- **RitualDecompositionPlan** – saved blueprint of a decomposed ritual sequence.
- **DecomposedStepTrace** – traces symbolic steps with codex links and tool usage.
- **CodexExpansionSuggestion** – proposed codex entries derived from swarm patterns.
- **SwarmCodificationPattern** – mined pattern data connecting prompts, rituals and codex clauses.

## View Routes
- `/codex/fragment/:clauseId` – fragment editor and export panel.
- `/ritual/decompose/:ritualId` – ritual breakdown planner.
- `/codex/strategy` – swarm-driven codex strategy dashboard.

## Testing Goals
- Verify fragments save lineage logs to `FragmentTraceLog`.
- Ensure ritual decomposition plans create `DecomposedStepTrace` records.
- Confirm codex strategy suggestions persist as `CodexExpansionSuggestion` items.
