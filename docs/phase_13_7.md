# Phase 13.07 — Visual Belief Mapping Tools, Role-Aligned Path Branchers & Memory-Driven Symbolic Arc Editors

Phase 13.07 introduces visual story architecture tools to MythOS. Users and assistants can now map belief vectors, visualize branching narrative paths by role, and sculpt symbolic arcs using memory and codex feedback.

## Core Components
- **BeliefMapVisualizer** – live vector map of the assistant/user belief state with codex nodes, rituals, and symbolic tags.
- **PathBranchingEditor** – timeline viewer showing archetype-aligned decision forks and ritual checkpoints.
- **SymbolicArcEditor** – tool to reshape story arcs using memory nodes, codex rules, and pacing guidance.

## View Routes
- `/belief/map` – interactive belief network view for the current assistant or user.
- `/paths/branching` – decision tree and narrative structure explorer.
- `/arc/edit` – symbolic arc editor for restructuring story threads.

## Testing Goals
- Validate that the belief map visualizes symbolic state correctly.
- Confirm the path editor displays branches based on codex and memory events.
- Ensure the arc editor rewrites story structures while reflecting codex law.
