# Phase Ω.5.1 — Cross-Assistant Ritual Feedback Grids, Mythic Role Reinforcement Trainers & Ritual Curriculum Marketplace Launch

Phase Ω.5.1 strengthens symbolic learning across assistants. Rituals are now rated across swarm agents using feedback grids, roles evolve through reinforcement trainers, and the curriculum marketplace goes live for prompt adoption.

## Core Components
- **RitualFeedbackMatrix** – stores ritual outputs, memory usage rates, and belief delta scores for multiple assistants.
- **RoleStabilityMonitor** – tracks an assistant's role confidence and codex drift over time.
- **RitualReinforcementSession** – runs interactive quizzes with memory playback to reinforce archetypes.
- **AssistantPromptAdoptionLog** – records curriculum injections and adoption metrics.

## View Routes
- `/ritual/feedback-grid` – compare prompt variations, memory use, and belief deltas across assistants.
- `/assistants/:id/reinforce-role` – run role quizzes and review confidence bars.
- `/market/curriculum` – browse curricula, view swarm usage, and inject to assistants.
- `/assistants/:id/mentorship` – adopt shared prompts and review mentor feedback.

## Testing Goals
