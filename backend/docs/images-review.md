    codex
    1. üìã Purpose
           Provides simple utilities to validate a URL and download a remote image to a local file path via streaming.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Uses Python‚Äôs `urllib.parse.urlparse` to reliably check for a scheme and netloc in `is_valid_url`.

            * Streams the download in 1 KB chunks (`stream=True` + `iter_content`) to avoid loading entire images into memory.

            * Calls `response.raise_for_status()` to detect HTTP errors early.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * The parameter `output_file` (a file path) is shadowed by the loop‚Äôs `with open(output_file, 'wb') as output_file:`; this makes the code confusing and could lead to bugs.

            * No timeout is specified on `requests.get`, risking a hang if the server stalls.

            * Does not validate that the response‚Äôs `Content-Type` is an actual image (e.g. `image/jpeg`, `image/png`)‚Äîyou could inadvertently save HTML or large non-image payloads.

            * Hardcoded chunk size (1024) and no maximum file size check; a malicious server could stream an unbounded payload.

            * Uses `print()` for errors instead of structured logging (`logger.error`), making it hard to integrate with the app‚Äôs logging system.

            * Missing docstring on `is_valid_url`, and neither function has type hints.

            * Returns a boolean on failure rather than raising, so calling code may not distinguish ‚Äúinvalid URL‚Äù vs ‚Äúnetwork failure‚Äù reliably.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Rename the file‚Äêhandle variable to something like `fh` (e.g. `with open(output_file, 'wb') as fh:`) to avoid shadowing the parameter.

            * Add a `timeout=` to `requests.get(...)` (e.g. `timeout=5`) and catch `requests.Timeout` separately.

            * Inspect `response.headers.get('Content-Type')` and raise if it does not start with `image/`.

            * Enforce a maximum download size (e.g. accumulate bytes and abort if > X MB).

            * Replace `print()` with a module‚Äêlevel logger (`import logging; logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`) and use `logger.error(...)`.

            * Add docstrings and type annotations:      def is_valid_url(url: str) -> bool: ...
                     def download_image(image_url: str, output_path: Union[str, Path]) -> bool: ...

            * Consider raising a custom exception on download failure so callers can handle errors explicitly, instead of returning `False`.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Relies on the `requests` library; any global session configuration (e.g. proxies, retries) will affect this function.

            * Downloads to arbitrary file paths‚Äîcalling code must ensure proper directory permissions and safe file names to avoid path traversal issues.

            * Consumers in the `images` app likely depend on this for reference‚Äêimage ingestion; improving validation here will harden uploads across the board.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * Unit-test `is_valid_url` with a variety of malformed and well‚Äêformed URLs (missing scheme, missing netloc, truly relative paths).

            * Use a fixture or `responses`/`requests-mock` to simulate:
                 ‚Ä¢ HTTP 200 with image MIME type, small payload ‚Üí asserts file written and returns `True`.
                 ‚Ä¢ HTTP 404 or other status ‚Üí returns `False`.
                 ‚Ä¢ Response with non‚Äêimage `Content-Type` ‚Üí raises or returns `False` after you add that check.
                 ‚Ä¢ Timeout scenario ‚Üí ensure it‚Äôs caught and returns `False` (or raises, per your design).

            * Test that large payloads beyond your max‚Äêsize threshold are aborted and cleaned up.

    thinking for 34s

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose
           Provide a single helper (`generate_absolute_urls`) to turn relative media file paths into full URLs by prepending your site‚Äôs `BASE_URL` and `MEDIA_URL`, while passing through
    already‚Äêabsolute HTTP(S) URLs unchanged.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Centralizes URL construction logic so callers don‚Äôt have to repeatedly concatenate `BASE_URL`/`MEDIA_URL`.

            * Gracefully handles both single‚Äêstring and list inputs.

            * Preserves any input URLs that already start with `http://` or `https://`.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * Uses `print()` for debug output instead of the app‚Äôs logging framework (`logger`).

            * Loads environment variables with `load_dotenv()` here‚ÄîDjango typically loads settings at startup, so this is likely redundant.

            * Unused import of `os`.

            * Doesn‚Äôt handle the case where `settings.MEDIA_URL` itself is already a full URL (e.g. a CDN host): always prepends `BASE_URL`.

            * No type checking: non‚Äêstring inputs (e.g. `None`, numbers) will error obscurely.

            * Swallows all exceptions to print then re‚Äêraise, rather than logging context.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Replace all `print()` calls with a module‚Äêlevel logger (`logging.getLogger(__name__)`) and use `logger.debug()` / `logger.error()`.

            * Remove `load_dotenv()` (and the unused `os` import) to avoid side effects on import.

            * Detect if `MEDIA_URL` is already absolute (starts with `http://`/`https://`), and if so use that directly:      prefix = settings.MEDIA_URL.rstrip('/') if
    settings.MEDIA_URL.startswith(('http://','https://')) else f"{base_url.rstrip('/')}{settings.MEDIA_URL}"

            * Add type hints and explicit input validation, e.g.:      def generate_absolute_urls(image_paths: Union[str,List[str]]) -> List[str]:
                         if isinstance(image_paths, (str, Path)):
                             paths = [str(image_paths)]
                         elif isinstance(image_paths, list):
                             paths = [str(p) for p in image_paths]
                         else:
                             raise TypeError("image_paths must be a str or list of str")
                         ...

            * Consider returning a single string when input is a single path, or clearly document that it always returns a list.

            * Add unit tests for:
                 ‚Ä¢ Relative paths ‚Üí correct URLs (with/without leading slash)
                 ‚Ä¢ Absolute `MEDIA_URL` vs relative `MEDIA_URL`
                 ‚Ä¢ Already‚Äêabsolute input URLs
                 ‚Ä¢ Invalid input types raising `TypeError`.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Relies on `settings.BASE_URL` and `settings.MEDIA_URL`. Changing those in your Django settings will alter all generated URLs.

            * Used anywhere in the `images` app (or elsewhere) to build media links for front‚Äêend consumption‚Äîbugs here would break image loading site‚Äêwide.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * Parametric unit tests covering:
                 ‚Ä¢ Input as single string vs list of strings
                 ‚Ä¢ Paths with and without leading slash
                 ‚Ä¢ Input URLs that already start with `http://`/`https://`
                 ‚Ä¢ `MEDIA_URL` set to relative vs absolute URL in settings
                 ‚Ä¢ Non‚Äêstring inputs to ensure a clear exception is raised

            * Integration test: configure `MEDIA_URL` to a CDN URL and assert that generated URLs do not mistakenly prefix `BASE_URL`.

images/helpers/post_generation_hooks.py

    command.stdout (code: 0, duration: 0s)


    thinking for 36s

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose
           Defines post‚Äìimage-generation hooks and prompt utilities for the `images` app:


            * `trigger_post_generation_hook(image_id)`: runs a series of side-effects (thumbnailing, tag enrichment, TTS queueing, upscale marking) after an `Image` record is created.

            * `prepare_final_prompt(image)`: merges a user‚Äôs prompt and optional style preset into a single ‚Äúfull prompt,‚Äù extracts the user-only portion, and returns the negative prompt
    plus style metadata.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Uses isolated `try/except` blocks around each hook step so one failure (e.g. thumbnail generation) doesn‚Äôt block the rest.

            * Logs meaningful, emoji-tagged messages at each stage‚Äîmakes it easy to scan logs for successes vs failures.

            * Local imports of optional features (e.g. TTS task) keep the module‚Äôs dependency footprint minimal and pluggable.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * Unused imports: `generate_absolute_urls` and `download_image` are imported but never used.

            * Thumbnail skip logic checks `image.style.image_path`, which sounds like the style‚Äôs own static image, not the generated image‚Äôs thumbnail‚Äîthis may misdetect when to skip.

            * Auto-upscale is only logged and not actually queued, so it‚Äôs a no-op placeholder.

            * Broad `except Exception:` catches without logging full stack traces (`logger.warning` only includes message), which can obscure debugging.

            * `trigger_post_generation_hook` lacks a docstring and type annotations, making its contract unclear.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Remove or implement the unused URL/download imports; if you intend to fetch remote source images, wire `download_image` into the hook.

            * Clarify thumbnail logic: check for the generated image‚Äôs `thumbnail_path` field (or a boolean flag) instead of `style.image_path`.

            * Wire up a real upscale task (e.g. `process_upscale_image_request.delay(image.id)`) or remove that section until ready.

            * Replace bare `except Exception:` blocks with either more specific exceptions or use `logger.exception(...)` to capture tracebacks.

            * Add a docstring and type hints to `trigger_post_generation_hook(image_id: int) -> None` so its purpose and side-effects are explicit.

            * Consider breaking the hook into smaller functions (e.g. `_generate_thumbnail`, `_enqueue_tts`, `_upscale_if_needed`) for easier testing and future extension.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Depends on `images.models.Image`, `images.utils.thumbnails.generate_thumbnails`, `images.helpers.prompt_helpers.enrich_prompt_tags`, and `tts.tasks.queue_tts_story`. Changes
     to any of those APIs or model fields (`prompt`, `style`, `width`, `height`) will break this hook.

            * Optional future video generation and download logic will further couple this module to external task queues and utilities.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * Unit‚Äêtest `trigger_post_generation_hook` by mocking the `Image.objects.get` lookup and stubbing out `generate_thumbnails`, `enrich_prompt_tags`, and `queue_tts_story`.
    Verify that each is called exactly once under normal conditions.

            * Test thumbnail skip path by providing an `Image` with a dummy `style.image_path` and asserting `generate_thumbnails` is not invoked.

            * Simulate exceptions in each hook step (e.g. make `generate_thumbnails` raise) and assert the hook continues through remaining steps while logging warnings.

            * Thoroughly unit‚Äêtest `prepare_final_prompt` with combinations of: no style, style without prompt, style whose prompt is already a prefix of the user prompt, and various
    negative prompts‚Äîassert the returned tuple matches expectations.

    1. üìã Purpose
           Compute the ‚Äúfinal‚Äù image prompt by merging the user‚Äôs input, an optional style preset, and an optional story‚Äêtheme prompt, while also combining negative prompts. Returns
    `(full_prompt, user_only, negative_prompt)` for downstream generation.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Safely handles missing attributes (`image.prompt`, `image.negative_prompt`, `image.style`) by defaulting to empty strings.

            * Prevents redundant concatenation: only prepends the style or theme prompt if it isn‚Äôt already contained in the user prompt.

            * Wraps the theme enrichment in a `try/except` so any failure there doesn‚Äôt break the core prompt construction.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * Duplicate functionality exists in `post_generation_hooks.py` with a similar `prepare_final_prompt`; two versions may drift out of sync.

            * Uses `hasattr(style, "prompt")` but doesn‚Äôt validate that `style.prompt` is a non‚Äêempty string.

            * Swallows all exceptions in the theme block (`except Exception:`) without logging, obscuring failures.

            * Hard‚Äêcoded reliance on a `story.theme_id` foreign key and unbounded query (`ThemeHelper.objects.filter(‚Ä¶)`), which could be simplified to `get()`.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Consolidate or deduplicate the prompt‚Äêmerging logic into one shared utility to avoid divergence.

            * Add a module‚Äêlevel docstring and type hints:      def prepare_final_prompt(image: Image) -> Tuple[str, str, str]:

            * Change the bare `except Exception:` to log a warning with context:      except Exception as e:
                         logger.warning(f"Theme enrichment failed for Image {image.id}: {e}", exc_info=True)

            * Validate that `style.prompt` and `theme.prompt` are truthy before using, e.g.:      if style and getattr(style, "prompt", "").strip():

            * Use `ThemeHelper.objects.filter(id=story.theme_id).first()` or `ThemeHelper.objects.get(...)` inside a `try` with `DoesNotExist` for clarity.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Relies on the `Image` model having attributes `prompt`, `negative_prompt`, `style`, and optional `story.theme_id`. Any schema changes there will break this logic.

            * Calls into `images.models.ThemeHelper`, so renaming or moving that model would require updates.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * Unit-test with an `Image` stub that has no style or story: expect `full_prompt == user_prompt`, `user_only == user_prompt`, and empty `negative_prompt`.

            * Test with `style.prompt` set and ensure it‚Äôs prepended exactly once, even if the user prompt already contains that substring.

            * Test theme enrichment: supply a fake `story.theme_id` that maps to a `ThemeHelper` with both `prompt` and `negative_prompt`, and assert both are merged correctly.

            * Simulate a `ThemeHelper.objects.filter()` raising an exception and confirm the function still returns just the base prompts (and logs a warning).

    1. üìã Purpose
           Provides a simple utility (`sanitize_filename`) that turns arbitrary prompt strings into safe filesystem‚Äêfriendly filenames by replacing all non‚Äêalphanumeric runs with

            * Avoids complex logic‚Äîkeeps filename sanitization atomic and focused.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * No handling of `None` or non‚Äêstring inputs; passing a non‚Äêstr will raise a `TypeError`.

            * Hardcoded length limit (50) with no way to configure per‚Äêuse; might be too short for some contexts.

            * Does not normalize case or trim leading/trailing underscores, which can result in filenames beginning or ending with `_`.

            * Drops all non‚ÄêASCII letters (e.g. accented characters) rather than performing Unicode transliteration.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Add type hints and input validation:      def sanitize_filename(prompt: str, max_length: int = 50) -> str:

                         ‚Ä¶

            * Make the length limit configurable (via parameter or Django settings) and normalize output to lowercase.

            * Trim leading/trailing underscores and collapse multiple underscores if needed (though current `+` quantifier handles runs).

            * Optionally integrate a transliteration step (e.g. `unicodedata.normalize`) to preserve accented letters.

            * Expand the docstring to document edge cases (empty input, unicode handling).
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Used wherever prompts become filenames (e.g. caching or storing generated images). Changing behavior here will affect file naming consistency across the `images` app.

121 images/utils/editing.py

    thinking for 30s

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose
           Provides helper utilities to interact with Stability AI‚Äôs image-editing endpoints:


            * `get_edit_endpoint(edit_type)`: Build the full API URL for a given edit operation (erase, inpaint, outpaint, etc.)

            * `build_edit_payload(request)`: Construct the multipart/form-data body (both file handles and form fields) given an `ImageEditRequest`-like object

            * `save_edited_image(image_data, request)`: Persist the returned image bytes to `MEDIA_ROOT/edited_images/‚Ä¶` with a timestamped UUID filename
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Centralizes the mapping of edit operations to their endpoint paths in a single `EDIT_ENDPOINTS` dict.

            * Streams POST payloads in multipart form (files + non-file fields) to minimize memory overhead.

            * Saves edited images into a dedicated subfolder with unique filenames (timestamp + UUID) to avoid collisions.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * `load_dotenv()` and direct `os.getenv()` calls bypass Django‚Äôs settings system‚Äîthese should live in `settings.py` or be injected there.

            * Hardcoded `HEADERS` include static client-ID, user-ID, version strings, and a potential `None` bearer if `STABILITY_KEY` isn‚Äôt set. They‚Äôre never actually used in this
    module.

            * `build_edit_payload` opens file handles (`open(...)`) but does not close them; callers risk leaking file descriptors.

            * No validation that `STABILITY_BASE_URL` or `STABILITY_KEY` exist‚Äîrequests will silently fail or authenticate with ‚ÄúBearer None.‚Äù

            * No docstrings or type annotations on `build_edit_payload` and `save_edited_image`, making their contracts ambiguous.

            * Assumes `request.input_image.path` and `request.mask_image.path` always exist; a missing mask/image field will raise an `AttributeError`.

            * The `"relight"` edit type maps to the same endpoint as `"replace_background"` but only `"relight"` sets a `mode=async` flag; this split logic could diverge unexpectedly.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Move the `STABILITY_KEY`, `STABILITY_BASE_URL`, and `HEADERS` into Django settings and use `settings.STABILITY_KEY`, etc., rather than `load_dotenv()` here.

            * Return or use the `HEADERS` in `get_edit_endpoint` or alongside `build_edit_payload`, and validate them before constructing the request.

            * Refactor `build_edit_payload` to open files in a context manager (or let the caller pass in file-like objects) so you can ensure they‚Äôre closed after the HTTP call:
    with open(...,'rb') as img_fh, open(...,'rb') as mask_fh:
                         files = {...}
                         # send request, then files automatically closed

            * Add docstrings and type hints:      def build_edit_payload(request: ImageEditRequest) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Tuple], Dict[str, IO]]:
                     def save_edited_image(image_data: bytes, request: ImageEditRequest) -> str:

            * Validate that `request.input_image` and `request.mask_image` have a `.path` attribute before accessing, and raise a clear error if not.

            * Consolidate the ‚Äúrelight‚Äù vs ‚Äúreplace_background‚Äù logic into a single code path or add a comment explaining why only one requires `mode=async`.

            * Consider calling `generate_absolute_urls()` in `save_edited_image` if you need to return a URL instead of a filesystem path.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Depends on an `ImageEditRequest`-like model having attributes: `input_image.path`, optionally `mask_image.path`, and fields like `prompt`, `negative_prompt`, `edit_type`,
    `left/right/up/down`, `creativity`, `search_prompt`, `style_preset`, etc. Changes to that model will break payload building.

            * Saves files under `settings.MEDIA_ROOT/edited_images`; any alteration to `MEDIA_ROOT` or folder permissions will affect this function.

            * Relies on PIL for image decoding‚Äîcorrupt or non-WEBP input bytes will raise errors here.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * **Endpoint URL generation**: unit-test `get_edit_endpoint` with valid and invalid edit types, and with `STABILITY_BASE_URL` ending (or not) in `/`.

            * **Payload builder**: craft a fake request object (with dummy `.path` attributes) covering each `edit_type` condition (`erase`, `outpaint`, `search_replace`, etc.) and assert
     that `payload` and `files` dicts contain exactly the expected keys and tuple values.

            * **File handle cleanup**: use a tool like `psutil` or monkeypatch `open` to ensure that after you ‚Äúsend‚Äù the payload, no file descriptors remain open.

            * **Image saving**: provide small valid WebP bytes, call `save_edited_image`, and verify that the file appears on disk under `edited_images/` with correct dimensions and
    format.

            * **Error conditions**: simulate missing environment variables, invalid `request` objects, or corrupt bytes to ensure clear exceptions are thrown or logged.

images/utils/hook.py

    thinking for 27s

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose
           Defines a single post‚Äìgeneration hook (`trigger_post_generation_hook`) that, given an `Image` ID, will:


            * Create a thumbnail if one doesn‚Äôt already exist

            * Enrich the image‚Äôs prompt tags

            * Queue a text‚Äêto‚Äêspeech narration based on the prompt

            * Mark small images for future upscaling (placeholder)

            * Log usage to `StableDiffusionUsageLog` with estimated credits
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Wraps each sub‚Äêstep in its own `try/except` so a failure in thumbnailing or TTS doesn‚Äôt prevent subsequent steps.

            * Uses structured logging with clear emoji prefixes to make it easy to scan logs for each stage.

            * Catches `Image.DoesNotExist` separately to handle missing‚Äêrecord situations cleanly.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * Unused imports: `generate_absolute_urls` and `download_image` are never called.

            * Thumbnail skip logic is based on `image.style.image_path`, which sounds like a style asset rather than the generated image‚Äôs thumbnail‚Äîlikely the wrong field.

            * The auto-upscale branch only logs an action but doesn‚Äôt enqueue any task or modify the DB, so it‚Äôs a no-op placeholder.

            * Hardcoded stub `estimated_credits_used=1` in the usage log‚Äîneeds a real computation or config.

            * No docstring or type hints on `trigger_post_generation_hook`, so callers can‚Äôt easily understand its signature or side-effects.

            * Broad `except Exception:` blocks with only `logger.warning(f"...: {e}")` risk losing stack traces for debugging.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Remove or implement the unused imports (`generate_absolute_urls`, `download_image`), or relocate them to modules where they‚Äôre actually needed.

            * Fix thumbnail logic to check the correct attribute on `Image` (e.g. `image.thumbnail_path` or a dedicated flag) rather than `style.image_path`.

            * Wire up an actual upscale enqueue call (e.g., `process_upscale_image_request.delay(image.id)`) or remove the placeholder.

            * Compute real credit usage (perhaps via a pricing table) instead of hardcoding `1`, and consider moving that logic into a service layer.

            * Add a docstring and type annotation:      def trigger_post_generation_hook(image_id: int) -> None:
                         """Run thumbnails, tags, TTS, upscale, and usage logging for a generated Image."""

            * In each `except Exception`, use `logger.exception(...)` or pass `exc_info=True` to capture the traceback.

            * Consider wrapping the final usage‚Äêlog creation in a `transaction.atomic()` if consistency between the DB and logs matters.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Depends on `images.models.Image` and `StableDiffusionUsageLog`; changes to those models (field names, relationships) will break this hook.

            * Calls into `generate_thumbnails` (from `images.utils.thumbnails`), `enrich_prompt_tags` (from `images.helpers.prompt_helpers`), and `queue_tts_story` (from `tts.tasks`), so
    any API changes there propagate here.

            * Enqueues TTS tasks‚Äîif your TTS system or queue configuration changes, this hook will fail silently under the current warning‚Äêonly logic.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * **Success path**: mock `Image.objects.get` to return a fake image with and without a style thumbnail; assert that `generate_thumbnails`, `enrich_prompt_tags`,
    `queue_tts_story`, and `StableDiffusionUsageLog.objects.create` are each called exactly once.

            * **Missing image**: pass a non‚Äêexistent ID and verify only the ‚Äúnot found‚Äù warning is logged and no other calls occur.

            * **Failure in one step**: make `generate_thumbnails` raise an error and assert that subsequent steps (`enrich_prompt_tags`, TTS queue, usage log) still execute and only a
    warning is logged for the thumbnail.

            * **Auto-upscale**: simulate an image with small dimensions, capture the log to confirm the ‚Äúmarked for upscale‚Äù message appears (and eventually, test the real upscale enqueue
     when implemented).

    Handles interaction with an external Stable Diffusion API to generate images from prompts.
    Supports various generation options including style presets, seeds, steps, and negative prompts.
    ... (120 more lines)

    thinking for 21s

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose
           Provides a single‚Äêentry utility to call an external Stable Diffusion HTTP API, passing in user‚Äêsupplied prompts and parameters, streaming back a WebP image, saving it to
    `MEDIA_ROOT/generated_images`, and returning status, file paths, and full URLs for front-end display (with fallback on error).
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Centralizes endpoint interaction and image persistence in one function (`generate_stable_diffusion_image`), avoiding duplication elsewhere.

            * Streams the HTTP response into memory with a timeout and checks `Content-Type` to guard against non-image payloads.

            * Generates unique, timestamped filenames via prompt-sanitization, `uuid`, and datetime to prevent collisions and maintain auditability.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * **API Key Handling**: The module loads `STABILITY_KEY` via `load_dotenv()` and into a global `api_key`, but the function signature also declares an `api_key` parameter
    defaulting to `None`. If callers omit `api_key`, the header becomes `Bearer None` instead of falling back to the global.

            * **Logging Secrets**: Logging at WARNING level prints the entire `headers` dict (including the bearer token)‚Äîthis leaks credentials in logs.

            * **Over-Verbose Logs**: All payload and URL info is logged at WARNING level; better suited to DEBUG.

            * **Hardcoded Timeout & Output Format**: 30-second timeout and `webp` are inlined; these could be configurable.

            * **Error Handling**: Catches all exceptions, logs them, and then returns a placeholder image URL. This may mask transient network issues from the caller.

            * **No Type Annotations or Docstrings**: The function lacks a signature docstring describing its parameters and return structure, making it harder for IDEs or future
    maintainers to know how to call it.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Rename the function parameter `api_key` to something like `override_api_key` (or default it to `os.getenv("STABILITY_KEY")`) so that missing args fall back correctly.

            * Remove secret‚Äêleaking logs: never log the full `headers` dict or bearer token. Demote payload logging to DEBUG and omit sensitive fields.

            * Parameterize (or move to settings) constants such as timeout, output format, and media subdirectory.

            * Add a proper docstring and type hints:      def generate_stable_diffusion_image(
                         prompt: str,
                         width: int = 512,

                         seed: Optional[int] = None,
                         aspect_ratio: Optional[str] = None,
                         steps: int = 50
                     ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
                         """Call SD API, save image, and return metadata or fallback."""

            * Surface HTTP errors to callers (e.g. re-raise or return an error code) rather than always swallowing them and returning a ‚Äúfailed‚Äù placeholder.

            * Validate that `api_url` and `api_key` are provided (or raise early) to avoid sending incomplete requests.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Depends on `settings.MEDIA_ROOT` and `STATIC_URL` for media file paths and fallback placeholder URL. Changing these settings affects where images land and which placeholder
    is served.

            * Uses `sanitize_filename` from `images/helpers/sanitize_file` and URL construction from `images/helpers/image_urls`; any change in those helpers ripples here.

            * Expects PIL (Pillow) to support WebP via `Image.open`/`save`; if your Pillow build lacks WebP support, this will raise.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * **Unit test success**: mock `requests.post` to return a valid WebP‚Äêcontent response with `Content-Type: image/webp`, plus a fake PIL‚Äêreadable bytes payload, and assert the
    returned dict has `"status": "succeeded"`, correct `file_paths`, and that the file exists on disk.

            * **Unit test HTTP error**: mock `requests.post` to raise `HTTPError` and assert the function logs an error and returns a `"failed"` status with a placeholder URL.

            * **Unit test non-image response**: mock a 200 OK with `Content-Type: text/html` and assert that `ValueError("Unexpected response format")` is raised or caught, resulting in
    `"failed"`.

            * **Parameter falling back**: call without passing `api_key` and `api_url`, assert it uses the module‚Äôs global `api_key` and that missing `api_url` triggers an early failure
    (if you add that check).

            * **Filename sanitization**: test that prompts with punctuation become safe filenames and are truncated as expected.

    1. üìã Purpose


            * `create_thumbnail`: Given a WebP image path, resize it to a smaller thumbnail (default 300√ó300) and save alongside the original.

            * `generate_thumbnails`: For each `PromptHelper` style (or a single style when an `image` instance is passed), invoke Stable Diffusion to generate a representative style
    image, save it, create a thumbnail, and attach it to `PromptHelper.image_path`.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Encapsulates thumbnail‚Äêcreation logic in a reusable helper (`create_thumbnail`) using Pillow‚Äôs `.thumbnail()` to preserve aspect ratio.

            * Logs each major step (generation start, success, failure) with clear emoji‚Äêtagged messages.

            * Uses Django‚Äôs `File` wrapper and `PromptHelper.image_path.save(...)` to integrate thumbnails into the model‚Äôs storage backend.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * **Ineffective skip logic**: The first `for style in prompt_helpers` loop logs skips for existing thumbnails but does not filter them out, so the second loop still processes
    those entries.

            * **load_dotenv() in utility**: Loading environment variables here is redundant; configuration should be centralized in Django settings.

            * **Hardcoded endpoint string**: The `api_url` for thumbnail generation is built with a literal `stable-image/generate/ultra` suffix, bypassing the
    `get_edit_endpoint`/settings approach used elsewhere.

            * **Unclosed resources**: `generate_stable_diffusion_image` likely opens files; ensure any open streams are closed.

            * **No return or status**: `generate_thumbnails` is void; callers cannot detect overall success or which styles failed without inspecting logs.

            * **Missing type hints and full docstrings**: Both functions lack explicit type annotations and only minimal docstrings.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Filter out styles with existing thumbnails before the generation loop:      prompt_helpers = [s for s in prompt_helpers if not (s.image_path and s.image_path.name)]

            * Remove `load_dotenv()` and read `STABILITY_BASE_URL`/`STABILITY_KEY` via `settings`.

            * Parameterize the thumbnail size, SD endpoint suffix, and generation steps instead of hardcoding.

            * Add type hints:      def create_thumbnail(original_path: str, size: Tuple[int,int]=(300,300)) -> str: ‚Ä¶
                     def generate_thumbnails(image: Optional[Image]=None) -> None: ‚Ä¶

            * Return a summary object or dict from `generate_thumbnails` to indicate which styles succeeded vs failed.

            * Wrap calls to `generate_stable_diffusion_image` in a context manager or ensure file handles are closed.

            * Expand exception handlers to `logger.exception(...)` for full tracebacks.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Depends on `images.models.PromptHelper` having `prompt`, `negative_prompt`, `name`, and a writable `image_path` field.

            * Calls into `images.utils.stable_diffusion_api.generate_stable_diffusion_image`; changes to that API or its return format will break thumbnail generation.

            * Uses `settings.MEDIA_ROOT` via the SD API helper indirectly (for saving files) and `generate_absolute_urls` to log URLs.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * Test `create_thumbnail` with a variety of image sizes and non‚ÄêWebP input (e.g. JPEG) to ensure it falls back gracefully when necessary.

            * Mock `generate_stable_diffusion_image` to return both success and failure payloads; run `generate_thumbnails` on a dummy `PromptHelper` instance and assert:
                 ‚Ä¢ Existing thumbnails are skipped entirely.
                 ‚Ä¢ New thumbnails are saved to `PromptHelper.image_path`.
                 ‚Ä¢ Errors in SD API calls log warnings but do not halt the loop.

            * Integration test: use an in‚Äêmemory SQLite DB, create a few `PromptHelper` entries, run the function, and verify that the DB‚Äôs `image_path` fields are populated and that

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose
           Provides a single function, `upscale_image`, to send an image and parameters (prompt, scale, style, etc.) to a Stability AI upscale endpoint, then returns the raw binary image
    data on success or raises on failure.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Uses a context manager (`with open(...)`) to stream the input image file without loading it fully into memory.

            * Centralizes API headers and base URL in module‚Äêlevel constants for easy reuse.

            * Includes basic type hints on `upscale_image` parameters for clarity.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * Redundant and direct `load_dotenv()` calls alongside `os.getenv`, bypassing Django‚Äôs `settings`; environment resolution should live in `settings.py`.

            * Duplicate `from django.conf import settings` import and unused import of `generate_absolute_urls`.

            * Hardcoded `HEADERS` with static client/user IDs and potential `Bearer None` if `STABILITY_KEY` is missing.

            * No timeout on `requests.post`, risking indefinite hangs.

            * Lack of a function‚Äêlevel docstring describing return value (binary data) and exceptions.

            * Catches all `Exception` but immediately re‚Äêraises, making the warning log redundant and not converting to a custom error type.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Move `STABILITY_KEY` and `STABILITY_BASE_URL` into Django settings (e.g. `settings.STABILITY_KEY`) and remove `load_dotenv()` here.

            * Remove unused imports, and consolidate duplicate imports of `settings`.

            * Add a `timeout` argument (default e.g. 30s) to `requests.post`.

            * Replace broad `except Exception:` with targeted exception handling (`requests.RequestException`, `FileNotFoundError`) and use `logger.exception()` to capture tracebacks.

            * Add a detailed docstring and return‚Äêtype annotation (`-> bytes`), and consider returning a small metadata dict rather than raw bytes alone.

            * Validate `upscale_type` against a whitelist, or centralize endpoint paths in a dict, similar to other modules.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Used by any image‚Äêupscaling task or view; changes to missing settings keys or endpoint paths will break all upscale flows.

            * Depends on `requests`‚Äîglobal session configuration (proxies, retries) will affect calls here.

            * Relies on underlying file paths in `MEDIA_ROOT` (if callers use `settings.MEDIA_ROOT` to build `image_path`).
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * Unit test with a temporary file: mock `requests.post` to return a 200 with valid image bytes and assert the function returns those bytes.

            * Simulate HTTP errors (e.g. 500 or non‚Äêimage content) and assert that `ValueError` or `requests` exceptions bubble out appropriately.

            * Test missing input file path to ensure `FileNotFoundError` is raised.

            * A small `debug_sd_env` task to verify environment variables
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Clear separation of concerns: each task handles a distinct pipeline step (generation, upscaling, editing).

            * Uses `@shared_task` to allow asynchronous processing and retries via Celery.

            * Wraps each network or I/O operation in `try/except` blocks and logs both successes (`logger.info/ warning`) and failures (`logger.error/ warning`) with contextual IDs.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * **Redundant environment loading**: Multiple `load_dotenv()`, `os.getenv("STABILITY_KEY")` / `STABILITY_BASE_URL` calls alongside Django `settings`, leading to duplication
    and potential drift.

            * **Secret leakage**: Logging full payloads and headers (including bearer tokens) at WARNING level risks exposing credentials in logs.

            * **Tight coupling to file paths**: Derives local file paths by string‚Äêreplacing the hardcoded `"http://localhost:8000/media/"` prefix, which breaks if `BASE_URL` or
    `MEDIA_URL` change.

            * **Unclosed file handles**: In editing and upscaling tasks, files are opened and passed to requests without explicit closure (though most requests libraries close them
    eventually).

            * **Inconsistent HTTP timeouts**: No timeouts on `requests.post` calls (for editing and upscaling), risking hangs.

            * **Error masking**: Broad `except Exception:` handlers swallow unexpected errors and fall back to empty lists or status changes, making debugging difficult.

            * **Lack of type hints and docstrings**: Task signatures and payload expectations are undocumented, increasing the barrier for future maintenance.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Centralize configuration: move all environment keys and base URLs into `settings.py` and remove `load_dotenv()` here.

            * Avoid logging sensitive headers and large payloads at WARNING‚Äîdemote to DEBUG and scrub out secrets.

            * Use `settings.MEDIA_URL` and Django‚Äôs `storage` API to resolve local paths and build URLs, instead of string‚Äêreplacing the hardcoded host.

            * Add explicit `timeout` parameters to all external HTTP calls (`requests.post(..., timeout=30)`) and handle `requests.Timeout` separately.

            * Narrow exception handling to expected exceptions (`requests.HTTPError`, `FileNotFoundError`) and use `logger.exception()` to capture tracebacks for unexpected errors.

            * Add docstrings and type hints to each task describing required payload keys (`payload: Dict[str, Any]`) and return values (if any).

            * Refactor common file‚Äêsaving and URL‚Äêgeneration logic into shared helper functions to DRY up code across generation, upscaling, and editing tasks.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * **Models**: heavily depends on `Image`, `Edit`, and `UpscaleImage` schemas; renaming fields or changing relationships will break tasks.

            * **Utilities**: calls into `images.utils.stable_diffusion_api`, `images.utils.upscaling`, and `images.utils.editing`; changes in those modules propagate here.

            * **Hooks**: runs `trigger_post_generation_hook`, which itself touches thumbnails, tagging, TTS, and usage logs‚Äîany change there ripples back.

            * **External services**: Stability AI and OpenAI credentials and endpoints must be correctly configured in Django settings or environment for these tasks to succeed.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * **Unit tests** for each task function by mocking external calls (`requests.post`, SD API clients, TTS queue, replicate helpers) and asserting:
                 ‚Ä¢ Correct status transitions on success (e.g. `Image.status == "completed"`)
                 ‚Ä¢ Fallback behavior on HTTP errors, missing records, or malformed payloads

            * **Integration tests** using Django‚Äôs `celery` test harness to run tasks synchronously, create `Image`/`Edit` objects, and verify DB fields and file writes.

            * **Error injection**: simulate file‚Äênot‚Äêfound, network timeouts, and ensure tasks catch and record failures correctly without hanging or crashing.

            * **Credential misconfiguration**: temporarily unset `STABILITY_KEY` or `OPENAI_API` and verify `debug_sd_env` reports the missing values.

        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells:


            * Duplicate imports (e.g. `viewsets`, `status`, `action`)‚Äîadds noise.

            * Magic strings for statuses (‚Äúqueued‚Äù, ‚Äúfailed‚Äù, engine names) sprinkled throughout‚Äîprone to typos.

            * `PromptHelperSimilarityView` loads and embeds every helper on each request‚Äîpotential performance and latency issue.

            * Hard-coded limits (top 3 results, carousel 10 items, default styles) lack configurability.

            * Broad `except Exception:` blocks without logging or error differentiation may hide root causes.

            * Use of `order_by("?")` for random sampling is inefficient on large tables.
        4. üîß Suggestions:


            * Extract magic strings (statuses, engine identifiers) into constants or an Enum class.

            * Remove duplicate imports and organize imports (group standard, third-party, local).

            * Add docstrings and type hints to all public methods for clarity and IDE support.

            * Refactor similarity lookup: cache embeddings or precompute helper embeddings to avoid runtime overhead.

            * Parameterize hard-coded values (carousel size, result counts) via Django settings or query params.

            * Replace broad exception catches with more specific exceptions and log stack traces for debugging.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts:


            * Triggers Celery tasks in `images.tasks` and `tts.tasks`, so any task signature changes ripple here.

            * Depends on `embeddings.helpers` for embedding generation and similarity‚Äîchanges to that API affect semantic search.

            * Reads/writes `SceneAudio` in the tts app; altering SceneAudioSerializer or model fields impacts NarrateSceneView.

            * Uses serializers across images and tts apps; serializer changes could break view payloads.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas:


            * Unit tests for `PromptHelperSimilarityView.get` covering empty query, no embeddings, and normal ranking.

            * Integration test for `StableDiffusionGenerationView.create` validating queued status, missing prompt error, and style resolution.

            * Tests for `UserImageView` actions: `delete_broken_images` removes only truly broken records and file cleanup; `retry_failed` only on `status="failed"`.

            * Test `PublicImageViewSet.carousel` returns up to N public images and handles no featured project.

            * Edge-case tests for `UpscaleImageView` and `EditImageViewSet` create endpoints (invalid types, missing IDs).

            * Behavior tests for `ThemeHelperViewSet.remix` ensure M2M relations and metadata are correctly duplicated.

            * TTS narration via `NarrateSceneView`: POST enqueues and returns SceneAudioSerializer; GET retrieves latest entry or 404.
