          23 prompts/utils/auto_reduce.py


    thinking for 14s

    codex
    1. 📋 Purpose
           Provides a utility `auto_reduce_prompt` that splits a long prompt into paragraphs and drops trailing paragraphs until the total token count (via `count_tokens`) fits under a
    specified `max_tokens` threshold.
        2. ✅ Good Practices


            * Single-responsibility function: clearly focused on trimming text by token budget.

            * Leverages shared `count_tokens` helper and `MAX_TOKENS` constant for consistency.

            * Early exit when input already fits under the limit—avoids unnecessary work.
        3. ⚠️ Concerns or Smells


            * Splitting by double newlines assumes paragraphs are delimited by exactly `\n\n`; inputs using single newlines or more complex formatting may be mis-split.

            * Only drops entire paragraphs from the end; if the first paragraph alone exceeds the budget, the result is an empty string.

            * No indication (e.g. ellipsis) that content was trimmed, which may confuse downstream consumers.

            * No logging or metrics when trimming occurs, so it’s hard to audit or warn when prompts are cut.

            * Lacks handling for edge cases (empty input, paragraphs larger than `max_tokens`).
        4. 🔧 Suggestions


            * Normalize splitting (e.g. via regex) to handle multiple blank lines or single newline boundaries.

            * If a single paragraph exceeds `max_tokens`, consider truncating within the paragraph rather than dropping it entirely.

            * Prepend or append an ellipsis (e.g. `…`) to the trimmed output to signal truncation.

            * Add a module-level `logger` and emit a debug/warning when trimming happens.

            * Enhance the docstring to explain behavior when paragraphs exceed the limit.

            * Add type hints on return (`-> str`).

            * Write unit tests covering edge cases: first-paragraph overflow, exact-fit, empty text, mixed separators.
        5. 🔗 Cross-App Impacts


            * Relies on `prompts.utils.token_helpers.count_tokens` and `MAX_TOKENS`; any change to token counting logic impacts trimming behavior.

            * Used anywhere prompt length needs enforcing (e.g. in prompt generators)—unexpected trimming could alter downstream LLM performance.
        6. 🧪 Testing Ideas


            * Test with a prompt whose total tokens < limit (should return unchanged).

            * Test with multiple paragraphs where only the last one pushes over the limit (should drop it).

            * Test where the first paragraph alone is larger than `max_tokens` (should return empty string or truncated version if logic updated).

            * Test mixed newline patterns (`\n`, `\n\n\n`) to ensure splitting behaves as intended.

            * Verify ellipsis or warning is emitted when trimming (if added).

26 prompts/utils/embeddings.py

    thinking for 21s

    codex
    1. 📋 Purpose
           Provides a thin wrapper, `get_prompt_embedding`, around the core `generate_embedding` helper to produce an embedding vector for prompt text, adding validation for blank inputs
    and centralized logging on failure.
        2. ✅ Good Practices


            * Clear single-responsibility function with a concise docstring and type hints (`-> Optional[List[float]]`).

            * Guards against empty or whitespace-only inputs, logging a warning and avoiding unnecessary API calls.

            * Catches and logs exceptions from the embedding layer (`exc_info=True`) to aid debugging while preventing crashes.
        3. ⚠️ Concerns or Smells


            * Module‐level logger uses a hardcoded name (`"prompts"`) instead of `__name__`, which may conflate logs from multiple modules.

            * Returns `None` silently on failure or empty input—callers must remember to handle `None`.

            * No control over embedding parameters (model choice, batch size, etc.)—all logic is buried in `generate_embedding`.

            * No retry or fallback logic for transient embedding service failures.
        4. 🔧 Suggestions


            * Switch to `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` to reflect the actual module path.

            * Consider returning an empty list or raising a custom exception rather than `None`, to make failure modes explicit.

            * Allow injection of embedding parameters (e.g. via optional function args or a config object) or at least document that `generate_embedding` is configurable elsewhere.

            * Add a brief unit‐testable abstraction layer to mock failures or inspect call counts.

            * Expand error handling to include retry with backoff for temporary glitches in the embedding service.
        5. 🔗 Cross-App Impacts


            * Relies on `embeddings.helpers.helpers_processing.generate_embedding`; any change there (signature, return type, exceptions) directly affects this function.

            * Used by prompt ingestion and prompt‐usage logging pipelines—altering its return contract (e.g. returning `[]` instead of `None`) will ripple through serializers and CRUD
    logic in the prompts app.
        6. 🧪 Testing Ideas


            * Mock `generate_embedding` to return a known vector and assert that `get_prompt_embedding` returns it unchanged.

            * Test passing an empty string and verify that it logs a warning and returns `None`.

            * Simulate `generate_embedding` raising an exception and confirm that `get_prompt_embedding` logs an error and returns `None`.

            * Add a test for whitespace-only input to ensure it’s treated like the empty case.

# prompts/utils/mutation.py

    from openai import OpenAI
    from typing import Optional, List
    ... (48 more lines)

    thinking for 21s

    codex
    1. 📋 Purpose:
           Provides a single utility, `mutate_prompt`, which takes an existing prompt text and a mutation mode (e.g. clarify, expand, shorten), sends it to the OpenAI chat API to rewrite
    the prompt accordingly, and—if given a `prompt_id`—re‐embeds the mutated prompt back into the Prompt record for downstream similarity or retrieval tasks.
        2. ✅ Good Practices:


            * Centralizes all mutation modes in a `MUTATION_MODES` dict, making it easy to add or adjust instructions.

            * Uses type hints (`text: str`, `mode: str`, `prompt_id: Optional[str]`) and returns a clean string result.

            * After mutation, automatically refreshes the Prompt’s embedding (via `get_prompt_embedding` and `save_embedding`), keeping semantic indices up to date.
        3. ⚠️ Concerns or Smells:


            * Hard‐coded model name (`"gpt-4o-mini"`) and fixed `max_tokens=1024` ignore the declared `MAX_MUTATION_TOKENS` and limit flexibility.

            * No error handling around the OpenAI call—network issues or API errors will bubble up unhandled.

            * Module‐level `client = OpenAI()` makes it difficult to mock or reconfigure (e.g. for testing or model selection).

            * Logging uses a generic `"prompts"` logger; better to use `__name__` for clarity.

            * If the first paragraph or entire prompt exceeds token limits, there’s no pre‐flight length check or trimming—potential 413 or truncated responses.

            * No docstring for `mutate_prompt`, and no mention of side effects (saving embeddings) in code documentation.
        4. 🔧 Suggestions:


            * Inject the OpenAI client or wrap it in a service class so tests can supply a mock client and settings can define model names and token budgets.

            * Respect `MAX_MUTATION_TOKENS` by checking input length and/or passing it to the API call.

            * Wrap the API invocation in try/except, log failures with context, and return a fallback or raise a domain‐specific error.

            * Update logging to:      logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

                 and drop the “❌” emojis from code‐level logs to keep log text parsable.

            * Add a docstring to `mutate_prompt` that documents parameters, behavior, and side effects (embedding save).

            * Consider returning both the mutated text and the new embedding vector (or an object) rather than implicitly persisting to the DB.
        5. 🔗 Cross-App Impacts:


            * Directly depends on `prompts.models.Prompt`—any change to that model’s primary key or field names will break the embedding write.

            * Consumes `prompts.utils.embeddings.get_prompt_embedding` and `embeddings.helpers.helpers_io.save_embedding`—changes in those helpers cascade here.

            * Downstream services that rely on up‐to‐date prompt embeddings (e.g. recommendation or similarity endpoints) are implicitly coupled to this mutation workflow.
        6. 🧪 Testing Ideas:


            * Mock the OpenAI client’s `chat.completions.create` method to return a controlled `choices[0].message.content`, then assert `mutate_prompt` returns it unchanged.

            * Test behavior when `mode` is invalid (should default to “clarify”) and verify the correct system instruction is used.

            * Simulate a missing `Prompt` for a given `prompt_id` (patch `Prompt.objects.get` to throw `DoesNotExist`) and assert a warning is logged without crashing.

            * Patch `get_prompt_embedding` to return `None` and confirm that the “Skipping embedding” path is exercised.

            * Simulate an exception in the OpenAI call and verify that it’s caught/logged (after adding error handling) and that `mutate_prompt` fails gracefully or raises a known
    exception.

    from openai import OpenAI
    from typing import List
    import logging
    ... (49 more lines)

    thinking for 19s

    codex
    1. 📋 Purpose
           Provides two OpenAI‐backed utilities for prompt engineering:


            * `reduce_tokens(text, model)` to automatically shorten a prompt while preserving intent.

            * `generate_prompt_from_idea(idea)` to turn a free‐form user idea into a polished system prompt.
        2. ✅ Good Practices


            * Each function has a single, focused responsibility and clear input/output (string in → string out).

            * Uses `try/except` around external API calls to prevent uncaught errors from propagating.

            * Centralizes the “assistant instruction” for prompt generation in a module‐level constant (`PROMPT_ASSISTANT_INSTRUCTION`).
        3. ⚠️ Concerns or Smells


            * Duplicate client instantiation and `load_dotenv()` calls at the module top—unnecessary side effects on import.

            * Hard-coded model names (`"gpt-4"`, `"gpt-4o-mini"`) and fixed parameters (`temperature`, `max_tokens`) with no way to override without editing code.

            * `reduce_tokens` swallows all exceptions and returns an error‐string payload, which downstream code may mistake for a valid prompt.

            * Logging is inconsistent: errors in `generate_prompt_from_idea` go to `logger`, but `reduce_tokens` returns a string rather than logging.

            * No docstring or type hint on `reduce_tokens`, and only minimal docstring on `generate_prompt_from_idea`.
        4. 🔧 Suggestions


            * Consolidate client setup: call `load_dotenv()` once in app startup, and instantiate `OpenAI` client in a factory or injected dependency rather than on import.

            * Extract model names, token limits, and temperature settings into module‐level constants or Django settings for easy configuration.

            * Add a docstring and type hint to `reduce_tokens` (`-> str`), and replace error‐string returns with either:
                 • Logging the exception (`logger.error(...)`) and re‐raising or
                 • Returning `None` to signal failure explicitly.

            * Use `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` so logs are tagged with the real module path.

            * Consider a shared helper to wrap `client.chat.completions.create`, handling retries, timeouts, and logging uniformly across both functions.
        5. 🔗 Cross-App Impacts


            * Consumed by any code that needs to auto‐shorten or auto‐generate prompts (e.g. prompt‐creation UI, ingestion scripts).

            * Depends on the OpenAI SDK interface; upgrades or changes to that library will need corresponding updates here.

            * If model names or prompt instructions change, downstream features that rely on particular rewriting behavior may break.
        6. 🧪 Testing Ideas


            * Mock `client.chat.completions.create` to return a dummy response object, and assert that both utilities extract and return `choices[0].message.content`.

            * Simulate an exception in the client call and verify:
                 • `generate_prompt_from_idea` logs the error and returns an empty string.
                 • `reduce_tokens` either logs the error (after refactoring) or returns `None`/raises (depending on chosen strategy).

            * Parameterize tests with various input lengths/models to ensure `reduce_tokens` still returns intelligible output when under vs. over the token limit.

            * Validate that the system‐prompt instructions (`PROMPT_ASSISTANT_INSTRUCTION`) remain unchanged and correctly formatted.

prompts/utils/token_helpers.py

    command.stdout (code: 0, duration: 0s)

          36 prompts/utils/token_helpers.py


    thinking for 22s

    codex
    1. 📋 Purpose
           Provides utilities for token‐level operations on prompt text:


            * `count_tokens(text)` returns the number of tokens (using tiktoken’s model encoding).

            * `smart_chunk_prompt(text, max_tokens)` splits a long prompt into paragraph‐based chunks, each annotated with its token count, so that each chunk “fits” under a configurable
    token budget.
        2. ✅ Good Practices


            * Leverages the `tiktoken` library’s `encoding_for_model` to get accurate token counts for a specific embedding model.

            * Defines a `MAX_TOKENS` constant to centralize the default budget and avoid magic numbers sprinkled throughout the code.

            * Chunking algorithm preserves semantic paragraph boundaries, avoiding mid‐sentence cuts where possible.
        3. ⚠️ Concerns or Smells


            * Hard‐coded model name (`"text-embedding-3-small"`) in `encoding_for_model`; changing models requires editing this file.

            * Splitting only on double‐newlines assumes consistent paragraph delimiters; single‐newline breaks or missing blank lines may mis-chunk text.

            * If a single paragraph exceeds `max_tokens`, that over‐sized paragraph is still emitted unchanged (no sub-paragraph splitting).

            * No docstrings on `count_tokens` or `smart_chunk_prompt`, and no logging of chunking events or warnings when paragraphs overflow.

            * Uses Python 3.9‐style `list[dict]` annotation—might break in environments targeting older Python without future imports.

            * No error handling around the `tiktoken` calls (e.g. unknown model name or encoding failure).
        4. 🔧 Suggestions


            * Extract the model name into a module‐level constant or configuration to make it easy to swap out embedding models.

            * Add docstrings for both functions, including parameter descriptions and return types.

            * Consider normalizing splitting logic (e.g. `re.split(r'\n\s*\n+', text)`) to handle variable blank‐line runs.

            * For paragraphs longer than `max_tokens`, optionally implement a fallback that splits by sentences or token windows rather than emitting an oversized chunk.

            * Swap to `from typing import List, Dict` and annotate `-> List[Dict[str, Any]]` for broader compatibility.

            * Introduce logging (e.g. `logger.debug`) when chunking occurs or when paragraphs exceed the budget.

            * Add unit tests (see next section).
        5. 🔗 Cross-App Impacts


            * Used by prompt‐reduction (`auto_reduce`) and any feature that needs to break content into digestible LLM payloads—changes here affect all downstream prompt-engineering
    utilities.

            * Relies on the `tiktoken` library and its encoding mapping; upgrading `tiktoken` or adding new models may require updating this helper.
        6. 🧪 Testing Ideas


            * Test `count_tokens` against known strings to verify token counts match expected values for the configured model.

            * For `smart_chunk_prompt`:
                 • Input text under the token limit → should return a single chunk with correct token count.
                 • Text with multiple small paragraphs where only the last pushes over the limit → last paragraph should be dropped into a new chunk.
                 • A single paragraph exceeding `max_tokens` → chunk list contains that paragraph anyway; optionally test fallback behavior if implemented.
                 • Verify combined lengths and ordering of returned chunks.

            * Edge cases: empty string, text with no blank lines, text with inconsistent line breaks.

    codex
    1. 📋 Purpose
           Exposes REST endpoints for prompt management and utilities, including:


            * Listing, creating, and retrieving `Prompt` records (with optional semantic‐vector search).

            * CRUD‐style read/update of `PromptTag` and user `PromptPreferences`.

            * On‐demand prompt engineering utilities: generating prompts from ideas, reducing/splitting prompts by token budget, auto‐trimming, analyzing readability metrics, mutating
    prompts via LLM, and re‐embedding all prompts en masse.
        2. ✅ Good Practices


            * Leverages DRF’s `@api_view` and `permission_classes` decorators to define concise function‐based endpoints.

            * Reuses serializers (`PromptSerializer`, `PromptTagSerializer`, `PromptPreferencesSerializer`) for input validation and consistent output shapes.

            * Integrates semantic search via PG vector operations, token‐based splitting, and OpenAI utilities to provide a rich prompt‐engineering toolbox in a single module.
        3. ⚠️ Concerns or Smells


            * Duplicate import of `smart_chunk_prompt`.

            * Raw SQL for vector‐search (`embedding <#> %s::vector`) tightly couples to Postgres+pgvector and may misbehave if `vector` is `None` or improperly formatted. No fallback path
     or error handling.

            * Almost every endpoint is `AllowAny`, including state‐changing operations (`create_prompt`, `mutate_prompt_view`, `reembed_all_prompts`), risking abuse.

            * In `mutate_prompt_view`, the call to `log_prompt_usage` passes a `Prompt` instance as `prompt_slug` and uses unknown keyword args (`source`, `context`, `extra`), mismatching
     the utility’s signature.

            * Mixed use of `print()` for error logging in `reembed_all_prompts` instead of a proper logger.

            * No pagination on large result sets (e.g. `show_all` listing, tag listing).

            * Hand‐rolled JSON responses duplicate work that DRF viewsets/serializers could handle more robustly.

            * Minimal or missing docstrings and type hints on view functions; inconsistent error response formats.
        4. 🔧 Suggestions


            * Refactor into DRF `ViewSet`s or `GenericAPIView` subclasses with built‐in pagination, filtering, and serializers to DRY up boilerplate.

            * Secure write endpoints with `IsAuthenticated` or custom permissions; lock down public access to read‐only where appropriate.

            * Centralize vector search into a service or manager, handle missing embeddings gracefully, and add try/except with logging around raw SQL execution.

            * Fix `mutate_prompt_view`’s `log_prompt_usage` call to match its signature (`prompt_slug`, `prompt_title`, etc.), or wrap that in a helper that accepts a `Prompt` instance
    correctly.

            * Replace `print()` calls with `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` and structured logging for failures.

            * Remove duplicate imports, organize imports by group, and add missing docstrings/type hints to each view.

            * Parameterize hard‐coded limits (e.g. semantic search limit of 20, recent lists) via settings or query params.
        5. 🔗 Cross-App Impacts


            * Depends on `prompts.models.Prompt`, `PromptTag`, `PromptPreferences` and their serializers—any schema or serializer change ripples here.

            * Uses embedding and token utilities (`get_prompt_embedding`, `smart_chunk_prompt`, etc.); updates in those modules will affect behavior of split/reduce endpoints.

            * Calls OpenAI via `reduce_tokens`, `generate_prompt_from_idea`, and `run_mutation`; changes to those utilities propagate directly.

            * Logs usage via `mcp_core.utils.log_prompt_usage`; signature changes in that utility will break prompt‐usage endpoints.
        6. 🧪 Testing Ideas


            * list_prompts:
                 • No `q`, `show_all=false` → empty list.
                 • `show_all=true` with `sort=tokens` vs default.
                 • `q=` triggers semantic search (mock `get_prompt_embedding` and raw cursor calls).

            * create_prompt & prompt_detail: valid vs invalid payloads, slug not found.

            * generate_prompt_from_idea_view: missing `goal` → 400; valid → calls `generate_prompt_from_idea` (mock) and `log_prompt_usage`.

            * Utilities:
                 • reduce_prompt, split_prompt, auto_reduce_prompt, analyze_prompt — missing text → 400; valid text → expected keys and values.

            * mutate_prompt_view: missing `text` → 400; valid → calls `run_mutation`, updates Prompt.embedding and logs usage correctly (after fixing the `log_prompt_usage` signature).

            * reembed_all_prompts: simulate a mix of successful and failing embeddings (mock functions) and verify returned `reembedded` count and that exceptions are logged.
