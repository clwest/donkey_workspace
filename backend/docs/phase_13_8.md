# Phase 13.8 — Archetype Fusion Ritual Editors, Belief-Based Plot Sculpting Tools & Assistant-Guided Narrative Transmutation Protocols

Phase 13.8 enables symbolic synthesis and narrative transformation. Users and assistants can merge archetypes, sculpt plotlines based on belief, and transmute story logic into new mythic forms.

## Core Components
- **ArchetypeFusionEditor** – interface for designing symbolic fusion rituals that blend assistant archetypes, codex tags, and ritual traits.
- **BeliefPlotSculptor** – visual editor for modifying plotlines based on codex rules, user beliefs, and memory vector alignment.
- **NarrativeTransmutationProtocol** – utility where assistants reshape story structures based on symbolic entropy and reflective drift.

### NarrativeTransmutationProtocol Model
```python
class NarrativeTransmutationProtocol(models.Model):
    initiating_assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    source_storyline = models.ForeignKey(CinemythStoryline, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    entropy_trigger = models.TextField()
    transformation_summary = models.TextField()
    transmuted_codices = models.ManyToManyField(SwarmCodex)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Evolves a story segment into a new narrative arc based on symbolic feedback patterns.
```

## View Routes
- `/editor/archetype-fusion` – build, preview, and perform role fusion rituals.
- `/plot/sculptor` – reshape mythline based on codex, memory, and belief.
- `/protocol/transmute` – apply symbolic pressure and rewrite the story.

## Testing Goals
- Confirm fusion rituals output merged roles with codex-compatible traits.
- Validate the plot sculptor shows belief compliance and codex-resonant branching.
- Ensure transmutation logs record codex deltas and ritual impact.
