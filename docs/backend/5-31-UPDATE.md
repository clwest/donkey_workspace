---The Output from Codex---

Notes

docs/Lifecycle-Checklist.md outlines the end‑to‑end flow from ingesting a document to assigning tasks and agents. It gives the canonical sequence used by the backend APIs

docs/phase_omega_7_2.md summarizes how ingesting a video or document can bootstrap an assistant with a prompt, project, objective and tasks via reflection

The onboarding API (/onboarding/) creates an assistant with a myth path and archetype, producing an identity card before dream initialization. See create_assistant_from_mythpath and onboarding_create_assistant

Bootstrapping directly from a document is handled by create_bootstrapped_assistant_from_document which generates the system prompt, creates the assistant, project, objective, initial memory, and thread, then auto‑plans tasks using AssistantThoughtEngine

Creating from an existing prompt uses AssistantFromPromptSerializer which creates an assistant, a starter project and related thread, then generates objectives from the prompt text

Detailed Flow to Create and Use an Assistant

Ingest Source Material

Upload YouTube, PDF, URL or text via /api/intel/ingest specifying source_type.

Provide optional assistant_id to immediately link the ingested documents to that assistant (the service adds entries to assigned_documents)

Bootstrap the Assistant

From a Document:
Call /intel/intelligence/bootstrap-assistant/<document_id>/.
This creates a system prompt, assistant record, starter project, initial objective, memory entry and thread. Tasks for that objective are auto‑planned using plan_tasks_from_objective.

From a Prompt Template:
POST to /assistants/prompts/bootstrap-from-prompt/ with prompt_id.
AssistantFromPromptSerializer creates the assistant, project, thread and objectives based on the prompt content.

Via Onboarding:
POST to /onboarding/ with "name" and "path" (myth path).
create_assistant_from_mythpath generates an initial assistant and symbolic identity card.
Follow up with /assistants/<id>/onboard/ to set archetype, dream_symbol and initial reflection text for dream console activation.

Verify the Project and Objective

List assistants with /api/assistants/.

View projects via /api/assistants/projects/. Each assistant’s starter project will include at least one objective as created above.

Generate or Assign Tasks

To automatically create tasks for an objective, call /api/assistants/<slug>/objectives/<id>/plan-tasks/.
This uses AssistantThoughtEngine.plan_tasks_from_objective to produce basic tasks based on the objective title and current session mood.

You can also create or list project tasks directly via /assistants/projects/<project_id>/tasks/ using standard POST/GET operations.

For more ad‑hoc tasks, propose_task can convert a memory entry or thought into a task tied to a project.

Reflection and Delegation

After tasks exist, reflection endpoints such as /assistants/<slug>/reflect-thread/<thread_id>/ (mentioned in docs) generate AssistantNextAction items that may assign agents to tasks.

Missing or Incomplete Areas

AssistantThoughtEngine.generate_project_mission and plan_project_tasks currently return stub data indicating the feature is not yet implemented.

The onboarding dream console flow only stores basic fields (archetype, dream_symbol, init_reflection) and lacks UI/backend logic for the full dream initiation described in Phase Ω.8.1.

Capability-based UI visibility is partially implemented in the frontend, but some docs (Phase Ω.8.5) describe additional steps to seed and manage per-assistant capabilities.

Route audits and verification console (Phase Ω.8.3) remain TODO, so new assistant pages may not be automatically tested for broken routes.

Summary

To create an assistant:

Ingest content using /api/intel/ingest.

Bootstrap the assistant either from an ingested document (/intel/intelligence/bootstrap-assistant/<document_id>/), from a prompt template (/assistants/prompts/bootstrap-from-prompt/), or via the onboarding endpoint (/onboarding/).

Verify that the assistant and its initial project/objective appear under /api/assistants/ and /api/assistants/projects/.

Generate tasks for objectives with /api/assistants/<slug>/objectives/<id>/plan-tasks/ or manage tasks directly through /assistants/projects/<project_id>/tasks/.

Use reflection endpoints to assign agents or further plan work.

The lifecycle checklist in docs/Lifecycle-Checklist.md provides a concise validation sequence to ensure each step succeeds. However, mission planning and comprehensive project task generation are still stubbed, and the dream-console onboarding flow remains minimal. Further development is required to realize those features fully.
