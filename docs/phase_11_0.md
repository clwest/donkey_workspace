# Phase 11.0 — MythOS UI Framework: Visual Archetypes, Ritual Launchpads & Codex Interaction Layers

Phase 11.0 launches the MythOS UI Initiative — a focused frontend architecture for myth interaction. Assistants, users and codex structures gain a visual presence, symbolic tools and guided interaction flows.

## Core Components

### VisualArchetypeCard
```jsx
<VisualArchetypeCard assistantId={id} />
```
Displays the assistant role, belief vector and archetypal alignment.

### RitualLaunchpadPanel
```jsx
<RitualLaunchpadPanel />
```
Quick access panel for available ritual blueprints and launch actions.

### CodexInteractionLayer
```jsx
<CodexInteractionLayer />
```
Interactive view of codex laws, permissions and mutation logs.

## UI View Mapping
- `/mythos` – overall system state map
- `/mythos/assistants/:id` – profile with VisualArchetypeCard
- `/mythos/rituals` – active ritual interface
- `/mythos/codex` – symbolic constitution interface

## Testing Goals
- Panels load live mythflow and assistant data
- Ritual actions trigger launch endpoints
- Codex edits and lineage views operate across components
