# Phase X.3 — Swarm-Oriented Memory Composer, Dreamframe-Aware Belief Tuning Interface & Auto-Ritualization Sandbox

Phase X.3 unlocks collaborative symbolic composition and belief modulation within MythOS. Users can remix assistant memory, adjust belief states through dreamframe alignment, and prototype ritual logic in a sandboxed simulation.

## Core Components
- **Swarm-Oriented Memory Composer** – create or align memory sequences across assistant clusters with visual threading and symbolic braids.
- **Dreamframe-Aware Belief Tuning Interface** – re-tune assistant beliefs via symbolic sliders, ritual triggers, and dream-weighted memory inputs.
- **Auto-Ritualization Sandbox** – simulate new ritual patterns by dragging codex clauses, memory triggers, and assistant states.

### SwarmMemoryEntry Model Extension
```python
class SwarmMemoryEntry(models.Model):
    cluster_id = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    symbolic_topic = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    entries = models.ManyToManyField(MemoryEntry)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Stores linked memory clusters for collaborative composition.

## View Routes
- `/memory/composer` – compose or remix memory sequences
- `/belief/tuner/:assistantId` – adjust belief profiles with dreamframe sliders
- `/ritual/sandbox` – test ritual logic in a visual simulation loop

## Testing Goals
- Validate memory sequences save to `SwarmMemoryEntry` with cluster ids and symbolic topics.
- Confirm belief adjustments modify `AssistantReflectionInsight` and `SymbolicBeliefProfile`.
- Ensure sandboxed rituals convert into `EncodedRitualBlueprint` when saved.
