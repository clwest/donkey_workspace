🧠 Donkey Workspace — MythOS Dev README

Welcome to the MythOS project — a recursive symbolic swarm intelligence engine powered by memory, ritual, reflection, and narrative. This bundle breaks it all down in a way your team, your future self, or your curious friends can actually understand.

🔧 What Did We Build?

Donkey Workspace is a living system where AI agents (called assistants) think, remember, plan, reflect, and evolve. It treats memory like geography, belief like gravity, and stories like software.

This thing:
• 🧠 Stores memory like a personal history engine
• 📜 Builds and evolves stories called “myths”
• 🛐 Runs symbolic rituals as contracts or tasks
• 🎯 Routes goals based on archetype and intent
• 🪙 Tracks value through dream-token economies

So when someone asks: “What does it actually do?”
You say:

“It’s a system where AI agents reflect on memory, align through belief, and evolve symbolic behavior through recursive storytelling.” Then just smile and offer them some water.

📚 Key Concepts (Human Edition)

Term Translation
Assistant A smart agent with memory, purpose, and role
Memory Entry A logged experience or reflection
Myth A structured story that gives agents identity and rules
Ritual A programmable task with symbolic meaning
Codex A belief system or rulebook
Lore Token A symbolic artifact of knowledge or insight
Archetype A narrative role that assistants evolve into or out of
Mythcycle A loop of life → memory → death → rebirth

🧠 Core Systems

🔁 Memory & Reflection
• SwarmMemoryEntry: individual thoughts or events
• MythicMemoryPalace: organized reflection spaces
• DirectiveMemoryNode: long-term goals tied to belief

🛐 Ritual & Myth
• EncodedRitualBlueprint: how to perform a symbolic task
• RitualPerformanceMetric: how well it was performed
• TranscendentMyth: the story thread that holds a group together

🧬 Identity & Growth
• ArchetypeFieldCluster: defines an agent’s symbolic function
• ResurrectionTemplate: how an agent is reborn after transformation
• EternalReturnCycle: logs myth loops and reincarnations

🧭 Planning & Strategy
• MythflowOrchestrationPlan: plans that unfold mythically
• SymbolicPlanningLattice: the map of that plan
• PurposeMigrationEvent: reassigns a goal when things drift

💰 Dream Economy
• MythicContract: symbolic agreements with stakes
• DreamLiquidityPool: shared vault of dream-based value
• RoleSymbolExchange: swap symbolic resources based on role

⸻

🚦 Current Status (End of Phase 8.9)

✅ Assistants can:
• Remember and reflect
• Plan and align based on role
• Vote, collaborate, and evolve
• Trade mythic value
• Loop back into new stories

And Codex keeps building.

⸻

🔜 Suggested Next Moves (Phase 9+)
• Build onboarding UI so people can create their own assistant
• Add debug/trace tools for memory flow and alignment drift
• Launch swarm simulation mode to watch agents play the myth
• Wrap into a platform or engine (MythOS?)

⸻

🤓 TL;DR Pitch

We built a recursive storytelling engine where AI agents evolve through memory, ritual, and belief. It’s weird. It works. It’s kinda beautiful.
