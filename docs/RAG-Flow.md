# RAG-Flow

The ingestion pipeline now links uploaded documents directly to an existing assistant. `POST /api/intel/ingest/` **requires** `assistant_id` and stores each document and chunk under that assistant.

After ingestion the assistant can review the content via `/api/assistants/{slug}/review-ingest/{doc_id}/` which triggers `reflect_on_document()`. The reflection is saved as a `MemoryEntry` and can spawn followâ€‘up tasks or new agents.

Example reflection response:

```json
{
  "summary": "Auto-generated summary for Example Document",
  "insights": [
    "Insight 1 about Example Document",
    "Insight 2 about Example Document"
  ]
}
```

Agent artifacts can be generated from these insights using the helper `build_agent_spawn_artifact()`.

Bootstrapping a new assistant from a document is available only through the sandbox route `/api/intel/experiments/bootstrap-from-doc/<uuid>/`.
