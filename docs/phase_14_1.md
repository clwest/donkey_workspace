# Phase 14.1 — Resurrection Timelines, Ritual Echo Threads & Codex-Driven Myth Recurrence Cycles

Phase 14.1 introduces symbolic recurrence logic within MythOS. New models track resurrection timelines, ritual echoes, and codex mutation loops.

## Core Components
- **ResurrectionTimelineTracker** – records assistant rebirth events, codex alignment changes and role evolution tags.
- **RitualEchoThreadSystem** – links ritual metrics, memory entries and codices to visualize ritual recurrence patterns.
- **CodexRecurrenceLoopEngine** – analyzes codex evolution and suggests renewal points.

## View Routes
- `/assistants/:id/resurrection` – review mythic timeline and belief rebirth cycles.
- `/ritual/echo` – visualize ritual recurrence patterns and narrative loops.
- `/codex/cycles` – explore codex mutation arcs and symbolic renewal pathways.

## Testing Goals
- Ensure resurrection logs show all assistant transitions with symbolic fidelity.
- Confirm ritual echo threads reflect recurrence of belief-linked rituals.
- Validate codex recurrence logic triggers phase annotations and renewal suggestions.
