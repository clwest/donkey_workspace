# Accessibility Guidelines

MythOS aims to meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards.

## Best Practices

- Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA roles on custom controls.
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard reachable with visible focus styles.
- Provide `alt` text for images or `aria-hidden="true"` when decorative.
- Maintain color contrast ratios of at least 4.5:1 for normal text.
- Enable high-contrast mode using the toggle in the navbar.

## Running a11y tests

Automated checks run with `axe-core`:

```bash
npm test --if-present
```

The `a11y.spec.js` file exercises key pages and asserts no violations.
