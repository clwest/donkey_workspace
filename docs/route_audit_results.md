Date: 2025-05-26

## Checklist
1. Attempted to run `python manage.py show_urls` but Django is missing in this environment.
2. Manually reviewed `backend/server/urls.py` to verify endpoints:
   - `/api/assistants/`
   - `/api/codexes/`
   - `/api/ritual-archives/`
   - `/api/agents/` and `/api/swarm/`
   - `/api/cascade/<clause_id>/`
   - `/api/collisions/`
   - `/api/stabilize/`
3. Checked `frontend/src/App.jsx` routes for matching paths.
4. No stale or missing routes found during manual audit.
