# Phase Ω.5.5.2 — Symbolic Chain Messaging & Agent Routing Negotiation Engine

Phase Ω.5.5.2 enables intelligent relay chains for assistant communication. Messages can now traverse a symbolic path of agents and each node may negotiate the next hop based on skill fit and routing tags.

## Core Components
- **RelayMessageChain** – stores the overall delivery path and routing intent.
- **RelayChainNode** – represents each hop in a chain with status markers.
- **RelayChainLog** – records progression and any fallback branches.
- **RelayRoutingProposal** – suggests candidate routes for a message.
- **AgentRouteFitScore** – evaluates how well an agent matches symbolic tags.

## View Routes
- `/relay/chains` – inspect defined chains and their status.
- `/relay/route-negotiation/:messageId` – view suggested routes and confirm the next hop.

## Testing Goals
- Verify chain models persist route metadata and progression logs.
- Ensure routing proposals compute fit scores using agent skills and tags.
- Confirm negotiation choices update the selected chain node.
