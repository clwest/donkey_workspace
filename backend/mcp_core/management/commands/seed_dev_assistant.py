"""Bootstrap a DevOps assistant and project with dev docs.

This management command is a quick start for linking a new assistant to a
project and seeding it with documentation. It performs the following steps:

1. Create (or fetch) a DevOps-focused ``Assistant`` instance.
2. Create a ``Project`` tied to that assistant.
3. Attach all ``DevDoc`` records to the project for context.
4. Create an ``AssistantProject`` record to log the relationship.
5. Seed an ``AssistantThoughtLog`` entry summarizing the docs reviewed.
