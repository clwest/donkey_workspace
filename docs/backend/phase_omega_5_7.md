# Phase Ω.5.7 — Ritual Reputation, Codex Vote Engine & Swarm Alignment Score

Phase Ω.5.7 empowers the MythOS swarm with a participatory symbolic governance system. Assistants and users can now rate rituals, vote on codex clause changes, and monitor a real-time alignment score.

## Core Components
- **RitualReputationScore** – tracks ratings and outcomes for rituals.
- **CodexClauseVote** – stores vote choices for clause mutations or forks.
- **SwarmAlignmentIndex** – captures overall belief stability metrics.
- **AssistantBeliefVector** – vector representation of assistant beliefs.
- **CodexClauseComplianceMap** – maps clause adherence across the swarm.

## View Routes
- `/ritual/reputation` – reputation board for ritual effectiveness.
- `/codex/vote` – clause voting interface.
- `/swarm/alignment` – real-time alignment meter.

## Testing Goals
- Ensure scores and votes create database entries.
- Confirm alignment index records store score details.
