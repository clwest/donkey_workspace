Here's a visual breakdown of the system architecture including the assistants, embeddings, memory, and mcp_core apps. Now we'll add in the two remaining critical pieces: `prompts` and `images`.

**âœ… Current High-Level Architecture:**

**ðŸ§  Assistants**

- Thought logging, project planning, CoT tracing
- Supports long-term memory and chain-of-thought reflection

**ðŸ“š MCP Core**

- Hosts agent reasoning, planning, reflection, and prompt usage logs

**ðŸ§© Embeddings**

- Chunked vector search, tagging, Redis-backed caching, smart processing

**ðŸ§  Memory**

- Stores user or assistant memory, links thoughts and projects, supports feedback

**ðŸª„ Prompts**

- Core prompt management system (manual, mutated, embedded, versioned)
- Includes tag inference, prompt mutation types, diagnostics

**ðŸŽ¨ Images**

- Structured visual prompt templates (PromptHelpers)
- Theme discovery and remixing (ThemeHelpers)
- Supports image generation for characters, scenes, and storybook content

Let me know what you want to do next: visually show data flow, highlight all Redis/embedding usage, or focus on one of the feature pipelines (e.g. prompt creation â†’ embedding â†’ tagging â†’ mutation).
