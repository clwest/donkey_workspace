# Phase Ω.6.7.2 — Deployment Standards Execution Loop

Phase Ω.6.7.2 completes the second major functional loop by activating the Deployment Standards Runner. Users can evaluate symbolic deployment standards for assistants and track results over time.

## Deployment Standards Runner

**View Route**
- `/deploy/standards`

**Features**
- Select environment or ritual context
- Choose assistant or auto-assign primary
- Submit symbolic evaluation task
- Display token usage, duration and output summary
- Linked clause and prompt trace

**Backend**
- `POST /api/deploy/standards/`
- Inputs: `assistant_slug`, `evaluation_tags`, `goal`
- Returns: `result`, `tokens_used`, `duration_ms`, `reflection_id`
- Logs to `DeploymentVector` and `BenchmarkTaskReport`

## Reflection Hook
- When `log_reflection=true`, a reflection is triggered after the evaluation and linked to the response.

## ✅ Dev Tasks
- Scaffold `/deploy/standards` UI
- Connect to backend evaluation endpoint
- Show result panel and history streak
