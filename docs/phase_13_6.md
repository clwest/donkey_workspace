# Phase 13.06 — World Mythpath Explorer, Symbolic Memory Synthesizers & Assistant-Guided Temporal Reflection Logs

Phase 13.06 expands MythOS with temporal navigation and symbolic synthesis tools. Users explore story evolution through the World Mythpath Explorer, generate compact summaries via Symbolic Memory Synthesizers, and reflect on their narrative arc using Assistant-Guided Temporal Logs.

## Core Components
- **MythpathExplorerComponent** – timeline UI to browse codex shifts, memory events and ritual arcs.
- **SymbolicMemorySynthesizer** – collapses memory clusters into archetypal summary cards.
- **TemporalReflectionLog** – assistant-driven timeline log of belief drift and codex affinity.

## View Routes
- `/timeline/explore` – World Mythpath Explorer
- `/memory/synthesize` – Create symbolic summary cards from memory clusters
- `/reflection/logs` – View assistant-generated temporal reflection journals

## Testing Goals
- Explorer shows codex, memory and ritual data for each mode.
- Synthesizer output respects belief and ritual input.
- Reflection logs capture assistant and user belief transitions.
