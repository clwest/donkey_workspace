# Phase 17.0 — World-Level Symbolic Handoff Systems, Inter-Civilization Codex Conflict Engines & Trans-Narrative Myth Merge Protocols

Phase 17.0 federates MythOS. Assistants, guilds and codices can now migrate across belief domains while preserving ritual continuity. Symbolic handoff protocols and conflict engines allow mythlines to be negotiated and merged at world scale.

## Core Components
- **SymbolicHandoffProtocol** – transfers an assistant and its codex between environments while logging memory bridge integrity
- **InterCodexConflictEngine** – compares two codices, maps symbolic disputes and proposes resolution scripts
- **TransNarrativeMergeProtocol** – unifies multiple storylines through a mediated merge of assistants and memory

## View Routes
- `/handoff/symbolic` – execute cross-node assistant handoff
- `/codex/conflict` – simulate codex conflict and resolution
- `/myth/merge` – combine storylines via ritual merge protocol

## Testing Goals
- Ensure handoffs retain memory and codex state
- Detect symbolic contradictions and propose merge or fork
- Log mediator voices and codex synthesis during narrative fusion
