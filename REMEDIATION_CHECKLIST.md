    - [ ] `/api/assistants/{id}/spawn/` ‚Üí POST `/api/assistants/{id}/children/`
  - [ ] Standardize error response format across all endpoints
  - [ ] Create API response serializer base class

- [ ] **Caching Strategy**
  - [ ] Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data:
    - [ ] Assistant profiles (TTL: 1 hour)
    - [ ] Memory chains (TTL: 30 minutes)
    - [ ] Document chunks (TTL: 1 day)
  - [ ] Add cache invalidation on updates
  - [ ] Create cache warming strategy for popular assistants

### Code Quality Improvements

  - [ ] Add connection pooling optimization
  - [ ] Create data archival strategy for old conversations
  - [ ] Optimize vector similarity searches with pgvector indexes

- [ ] **API Performance**
  - [ ] Implement request/response compression
  - [ ] Add ETag support for caching
  - [ ] Create batch endpoints for bulk operations
  - [ ] Implement GraphQL for flexible data fetching

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **Logging Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Implement structured logging with JSON format
  - [ ] Add correlation IDs for request tracking
  - [ ] Create log aggregation with ELK stack
  - [ ] Set up log retention policies

- [ ] **Metrics & Alerting**
  - [ ] Add Prometheus metrics for:
    - [ ] API response times
    - [ ] Database query performance
    - [ ] Celery task execution times
    - [ ] Memory usage patterns
  - [ ] Create Grafana dashboards
  - [ ] Set up alerting for critical thresholds

- [ ] **Health Checks**
  - [ ] Create `/health/` endpoint for basic health
  - [ ] Create `/health/ready/` for readiness check
