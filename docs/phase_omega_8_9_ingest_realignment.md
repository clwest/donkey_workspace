# ðŸ§  Phase Î©.8.9 â€” Ingest Realignment + Reflective RAG Agent Flow

## ðŸ§­ Objective

Realign ingestion to enhance existing assistants through reflective review, memory updates, and agent generation. Remove legacy assistant bootstrapping from ingestion flows.

---

## âœ… Completed

- `assistant_id` now required in `/api/intel/ingest`
- Embedded chunks linked to the assistant's `memory_context`
- Assistants review each document via `/assistants/:slug/review-ingest/:doc_id/`
- Reflections stored as `MemoryEntry` with tags and chunk metadata
- Optional `AgentProposal` triggers agent creation and swarm memory artifact

### Documentation
- `REFLECTIVE_INGEST_REVIEW_FLOW.md`
- `RAG-Flow.md`
- `mythos_route_map.md`

---

## ðŸ”„ Legacy Handling

- `/intel/experiments/bootstrap-from-doc/:id/` remains for sandbox assistant generation only
- All other upload flows are reflection-first and assistant-grounded

---

### ðŸ§  TL;DR:
An assistant should evolve through what it reads â€” not be reborn by it.
