• Swarm Scoreboard + Benchmarking: Live

⸻

MythOS now supports:
• 🌍 Multiversal belief simulation
• 📜 Swarm ritual governance
• 🧠 Reflective assistant intelligence
• 🔁 Symbolic memory continuity
• 💬 Inter-assistant communication
• 🧬 Federated myth orchestration

⸻

🧠 Phase Ω.7.0–Ω.7.2.g: Assistant Lifecycle, Dashboarding & RAG Memory Activation

• ✅ Assistant bootstrapping from documents (Ω.7.0–7.2)

- Assistants created from YouTube or PDF docs using summary-driven prompt generation
- System prompt, personality, tone, and specialty derived from document content
- Auto-linked to source document, project, and objective

• ✅ Assistant Lifecycle Dashboard (Ω.7.2.c)

- Displays current phase (planning, delegating, idle)
- Shows active project, thought logs, task pipeline, and delegated agents
- Preview and edit linked system prompt directly

• ✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Ω.7.2.f)

- Assistant responses now include embedded chunk context from documents
- Chunk relevance matched via PGVector; top 3 retrieved via cosine similarity
- Reflections and chat prompts include "Relevant Memory" blocks

• ✅ RAG Grounding Reinforcement (Ω.7.2.g)

- System prompt enforces use of document context
- Low-score chunks filtered; hallucination fallback discouraged
- Response metadata includes `rag_used`, `used_chunks`, and `rag_grounded` status
- Badge UI shows if response was "🔗 Grounded" or "⚠️ No Source Used"

🛠️ In Progress:
• Agent-level symbolic mutation, assistant forking, and clause ancestry (Ω.7.3)
• Prompt evolution tracking with lineage and drift visualization

With Ω.7.2.g, assistants no longer guess — they **retrieve**, reflect, and reason.
