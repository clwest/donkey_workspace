ðŸ“˜ MODULE_ROADMAP.md â€” MindOS Module Overview & Purpose

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Provide architectural clarity across your Django apps by:
	â€¢	Mapping core system responsibilities
	â€¢	Highlighting key capabilities and data patterns (embeddings, RAG, reflection)
	â€¢	Grouping related apps into feature clusters
	â€¢	Guiding Codex to merge deeply by referencing module intent

ðŸ§© Module Clusters & Descriptions

1. Memory & Embedding Stack
	â€¢	intel_core / embedding_utils
â†’ Handles text chunking, embedding generation, and storage (PGVector).
Capability flags: embedding: true, vector fields present.
	â€¢	memory
â†’ Stores semantic memory entries, history logs, and retrieval metadata.
	â€¢	rag / retrieval modules
â†’ RAG orchestration, similarity search, query routing.

2. Reflection & Assistant Reasoning
	â€¢	reflection_engine / assistant_thoughts
â†’ Manages user reflection prompts, drift detection, feedback loops.
	â€¢	agents / assistant
â†’ Defines assistant workflows: assistant prompts, action chains, decision logic.
	â€¢	prompts / prompt_usage_log
â†’ Tracks prompt templates, prompt mutations, and usage history.

3. Glossary & Anchoring
	â€¢	glossary
â†’ Anchor definitions, glossary entries, concept linking for semantic memory.

4. Training & Workflow Tools
	â€¢	training / insights
â†’ Collects training journeys, usage insights, model fine-tuning logs.
	â€¢	tools
â†’ Utility scripts, ingestion pipelines, parsing routines.

ðŸ“¦ Integration Suggestions
	â€¢	Merge embedding & memory: Retain a unified MemoryEntry with semantic fields + vector embeddings.
	â€¢	Unify assistant engines: Merge agents, reflection_engine, and prompts logic into a core assistant service.
	â€¢	Centralize retrieval: Consolidate RAG modules under memory/retrieval.py.
	â€¢	Glossary anchoring: Integrate glossary concept resolution into reflection chain backend.
	â€¢	Strip training cruft: Archive or defer heavy training pipelines; focus on core runtime flows.

ðŸ“Œ Instructions for Codex
	â€¢	Preserve embeddings, RAG, reflection, and glossary logic, referencing this roadmap.
	â€¢	Merge intelligently using capability overlaps â€” use model-field flags to detect vector fields.
	â€¢	Remove duplicates, especially models like Thought vs MemoryEntry vs ReflectionLog.
	â€¢	Reorganize into the structural outline provided, ensuring tests and docs follow.
	â€¢	Maintain reflection + assistant loop flow as a core user journey.
