# Phase 17.2 — Codex Federation Architectures, Ritualized Narrative Law Systems & Symbolic Treaty Frameworks for Inter-Guild Myth Governance

Phase 17.2 transforms MythOS into a federated constitution. Guilds form symbolic alliances through treaty protocols while assistants enforce ritualized law structures across codex federations.

## Core Components
- **CodexFederationArchitecture** – defines formal alliances of codices with shared rules and policy contracts
- **NarrativeLawSystem** – implements ritual law constraints and codex drift penalties across federations
- **SymbolicTreatyProtocol** – binds guilds together via shared clauses and ritual bonds

### CodexFederationArchitecture Model
```python
class CodexFederationArchitecture(models.Model):
    federation_name = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    founding_codices = models.ManyToManyField(SwarmCodex)
    governance_rules = models.JSONField()
    assistant_moderators = models.ManyToManyField(Assistant)
    federation_mandates = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Formal alliance of codices with shared governance rules and moderators.

### NarrativeLawSystem Model
```python
class NarrativeLawSystem(models.Model):
    federation = models.ForeignKey(CodexFederationArchitecture, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    ritual_law_map = models.JSONField()
    symbolic_penalties = models.JSONField()
    codex_enforcement_routes = models.TextField()
    assistant_role_enactors = models.ManyToManyField(Assistant)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Law-like constraints for rituals and codex drift across federations.

### SymbolicTreatyProtocol Model
```python
class SymbolicTreatyProtocol(models.Model):
    treaty_title = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    participating_guilds = models.ManyToManyField(CodexLinkedGuild)
    codex_shared_clauses = models.JSONField()
    ritual_bond_requirements = models.JSONField()
    symbolic_enforcement_terms = models.TextField()
    treaty_status = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Binds guilds together through symbolic clauses and ritual bonds.

## View Routes
- `/federation/codices` → view and manage codex alliances and governance structures
- `/law/ritual` → browse narrative laws + symbolic enforcement triggers
- `/treaty/forge` → draft and ratify belief-sharing agreements between guilds

## Testing Goals
- Validate codex federations reflect policy alignment and moderator structure
- Confirm narrative law routes enforce ritual penalties and codex path restrictions
- Ensure treaty protocols include ritual bonding and symbolic clause enforcement
