# Phase 16.4 — Ritual Compression Caches, Assistant Deployment Auto-Restarters & Codex Integrity Proof-of-Symbol Engines

Phase 16.4 enhances MythOS system resilience and recovery performance. It introduces symbolic ritual compression caches to reduce recovery payloads, auto-restart logic for failed assistant deployments, and codex integrity verifiers that generate proof-of-symbol hashes for belief correctness.

## Core Components
- **RitualCompressionCache** – stores compressed ritual payloads for rapid recovery and symbolic verification
- **AssistantDeploymentAutoRestarter** – auto-recovers assistants from failure states by restoring ritual cache and codex alignment
- **CodexProofOfSymbolEngine** – generates codex proof-of-symbol hashes to ensure mutation history integrity and directive correctness

### RitualCompressionCache Model
```python
class RitualCompressionCache(models.Model):
    assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    compressed_ritual_data = models.JSONField()
    symbolic_signature_hash = models.CharField(max_length=256)
    entropy_score = models.FloatField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Stores compressed ritual payloads for rapid recovery and symbolic verification.

### AssistantDeploymentAutoRestarter Model
```python
class AssistantDeploymentAutoRestarter(models.Model):
    assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    last_known_state = models.TextField()
    symbolic_fallback_path = models.TextField()
    restart_trigger_reason = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    successful_redeploy_flag = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Auto-recovers assistants from failure states by restoring ritual cache and codex alignment.

### CodexProofOfSymbolEngine Model
```python
class CodexProofOfSymbolEngine(models.Model):
    codex = models.ForeignKey(SwarmCodex, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    symbolic_checksum = models.CharField(max_length=256)
    directive_path_log = models.JSONField()
    mutation_trail_hash = models.TextField()
    proof_verification_status = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Generates codex proof-of-symbol hashes to ensure mutation history integrity and directive correctness.

## View Routes
- `/ritual/compression` → view and manage cached ritual recovery payloads
- `/assistants/:id/restart` → track auto-restart events and fallback history
- `/codex/proof` → inspect proof-of-symbol logs and codex mutation verification

## Testing Goals
- Validate ritual cache hashes match compressed data and symbolic intent
- Confirm assistant auto-restarts properly restore assistant to mythpath-ready state
- Ensure codex proof-of-symbol chain reflects accurate mutation lineage and directive paths
