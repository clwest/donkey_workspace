# Phase 14.4 — Mythic Cycle Export Interfaces, Multi-Assistant Reflection Chains & Ritual-Led Narrative Reincarnation Frameworks

Phase 14.4 finalizes the symbolic loop system with narrative export, reflection chaining and reincarnation ritual flows. MythOS can now output full cycle packages, connect assistant reflections across generations and rebirth stories through guided rituals.

## Core Components
- **MythicCycleExporter** – interface for exporting complete myth timelines, codex paths and symbolic transformation threads.
- **AssistantReflectionChainSystem** – links reflections across assistants to build layered belief narratives.
- **NarrativeReincarnationFramework** – generates new story states through ritual prompts, role rebirth and memory reintroduction.

```python
class MythicCycleExporter(models.Model):
    assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    cycle_title = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    included_memory = models.ManyToManyField(SwarmMemoryEntry)
    codex_snapshots = models.ManyToManyField(SwarmCodex)
    ritual_threads = models.JSONField()
    export_format = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Exports a myth cycle as a JSON, markdown or PDF package for reuse or reflection.

## View Routes
- `/export/cycle` – package myth, codex and ritual sequence as a story capsule.
- `/reflection/chain` – explore and build multi-assistant belief linkages.
- `/assistant/:id/reincarnate` – perform symbolic rebirth ritual and evolution.

## Testing Goals
- Validate export packages contain correct symbolic content and structure.
- Confirm reflection chains track across time and role correctly.
- Ensure reincarnation rituals update assistant appearance and codex alignment.
