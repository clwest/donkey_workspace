# Phase 15.9 — Assistant-Driven Myth Planning Systems, Belief-Weighted Codex Scripting Tools & Ritual-Optimized Directive Programming Layers

Phase 15.9 completes MythOS Phase 15 by giving assistants the tools to strategize belief, write codex logic, and structure ritual directives. Assistants coordinate belief evolution with structured planners, codex editors and ritualized intention compilers.

## Core Components
- **MythPlanningSystem** – assistant-led strategic planning system for symbolic objectives.
- **BeliefCodexScriptingTool** – codex segment editor with role-based scaffolds and ritual hooks.
- **RitualDirectiveCompiler** – matches rituals to directive execution goals using codex constraints.

### MythPlanningSystem Model
```python
class MythPlanningSystem(models.Model):
    assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    strategic_objective = models.TextField()
    ritual_sequence = models.JSONField()
    codex_nodes = models.ManyToManyField(SwarmCodex)
    narrative_branch_proposals = models.JSONField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Assistant-led strategic planning system for symbolic objectives.

### BeliefCodexScriptingTool Component
Features:
- Codex segment editing with symbolic tag constraints.
- Role-based script scaffolding (Guardian, Oracle, etc.).
- Ritual hooks and directive links.
- Optional AI assistant suggestions for codex tone consistency.

### RitualDirectiveCompiler Model
```python
class RitualDirectiveCompiler(models.Model):
    directive = models.ForeignKey(DirectiveMemoryNode, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    ritual_support = models.ManyToManyField(EncodedRitualBlueprint)
    codex_path_reference = models.ForeignKey(SwarmCodex, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    optimized_execution_map = models.JSONField()
    symbolic_yield_score = models.FloatField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Matches rituals to directive execution goals using codex constraints.

## View Routes
- `/myth/plan` – assistant-driven symbolic goal planning UI.
- `/codex/script` – codex logic scripting tool with role-aware editing.
- `/directives/:id/optimize` – compile ritualized execution path.

## Testing Goals
- Validate myth planners allow forward narrative intent across rituals.
- Confirm codex scripting enforces tone, codex law, and tag alignment.
- Ensure directive compiler matches ritual logic to intent path.

Closes Phase 15 Core. Prepares for Phase 16 — System-Wide Symbolic Resilience Tools, MythOS Network Propagation & Belief-Oriented Deployment Strategies.
