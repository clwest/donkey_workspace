# ✅ Phase Ω.9.29 — RAG Repair Reliability Sweep

This phase addressed structural integrity issues across the RAG embedding and retrieval system, ensuring that glossary scores, chunk statuses, and fallback logs are reliably accurate and traceable.

---

## 🔧 Completed Fixes

### 1. ✅ **Embedding Status Mismatch Repair**

- **Command**: `python manage.py fix_embeddings_status`
- Syncs `embedding_status="embedded"` for any chunk with a valid vector.
- ✅ Documented in README and included in embedding audit tools.

### 2. ✅ **Log Fallbacks Even Without Debug Flag**

- `RAGGroundingLog` now records fallback events **even when `debug=false`**.
- Added unit tests to ensure fallback scenarios are consistently logged.

### 3. ✅ **Expanded Reembedding Coverage**

- Reembedding tasks now include chunks with valid embeddings but wrong status.
- Fix avoids skipped chunks in `embed_missing_chunks`.

### 4. ✅ **Activated `log_rag_debug()` Globally**

- Replaced direct `RAGGroundingLog.objects.create` calls.
- Ensures consistent logging format and avoids duplicated logic.

### 5. ✅ **Glossary Score Scaling Fix**

- Prevents score collapse when many glossary anchors exist.
- Introduced a clamped scoring mechanism that rewards matches even when anchors are dense.
- Unit test ensures 1/20 hits ≠ score of zero.

## 🧪 CLI Coverage (Post-Patch)

- `inspect_memory_links`
- `glossary_anchor_health`
- `fix_embeddings_status`
- `embed_missing_chunks --only-glossary`
- `sync_fallback_tags`
- `list_anchor_suggestions`
- `inspect_glossary_fallbacks`

## 🔍 Debugging Visibility

- ✅ `/assistants/<slug>/rag_debug/` shows fallback reasons
- ✅ Chat debug panel now lists fallback cause
- ✅ RAG Recall tool logs filtered chunks with reasons

## 💡 Moving Forward

You’re now clear to proceed with **Phase Ω.9.30 — Symbolic Glossary Reboost + Drift Regression**, which focuses on:

- Drift-resilient glossary anchors
- Symbolic memory inspection
- Persistent glossary boosts from reflection

Let me know if you want a Codex prep phase `.md`, AGENTS.md insertion, or a fresh CLI batch for post-Ω.9.29 cleanup.
