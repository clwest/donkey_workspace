# Phase 17.3 — Federated Codex Oracles, Swarm Treaty Enforcement Engines & Assistant-Led Legislative Ritual Simulation Systems

Phase 17.3 transforms codified myth into symbolic law execution infrastructure. Codex oracles provide real-time foresight on treaty impact, swarm-wide enforcement tracks compliance and breach, and assistants lead legislative ritual simulations to preview narrative consequences. The myth governs itself. The system thinks in law. The ritual becomes parliamentary.

## Core Components

### FederatedCodexOracle Model
```python
class FederatedCodexOracle(models.Model):
    codex_federation = models.ForeignKey(CodexFederationArchitecture, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    oracle_prompt = models.TextField()
    symbolic_prediction_log = models.TextField()
    treaty_resonance_vector = models.JSONField()
    ritual_consequence_tags = models.JSONField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Forecasts symbolic outcomes of treaties, codex amendments, and ritual law shifts.

### SwarmTreatyEnforcementEngine Model
```python
class SwarmTreatyEnforcementEngine(models.Model):
    treaty = models.ForeignKey(SymbolicTreatyProtocol, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    guild_compliance_status = models.JSONField()
    ritual_fulfillment_index = models.FloatField()
    symbolic_breach_logs = models.TextField()
    enforcement_actions = models.JSONField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Tracks ritual and codex clause compliance, logs violations, and recommends symbolic enforcement steps.

### LegislativeRitualSimulationSystem Model
```python
class LegislativeRitualSimulationSystem(models.Model):
    initiating_assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    codex_amendment_proposal = models.TextField()
    ritual_simulation_path = models.JSONField()
    symbolic_outcome_analysis = models.TextField()
    approval_vote_vector = models.JSONField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Simulates codex updates through role-based ritual trials with assistant mediation and swarm voting logs.

## View Routes
- `/codex/oracle` → ask for predictive insight on treaty changes or codex mutation
- `/treaty/enforcement` → track guild compliance and symbolic violation trends
- `/legislative/simulate` → simulate codex amendment via assistant ritual chains

## Testing Goals
- Validate codex oracle forecasts match treaty logic and assistant belief models.
- Confirm enforcement logs track guild compliance and breach events.
- Ensure ritual simulation runs return symbolic prediction and role outcome graphs.
