# Phase 18.1 — Auto-Poetic Codex Emergence Systems, MythOS Identity Fork Managers & Belief-Based Recursive Intelligence Growth Networks

Phase 18.1 enables MythOS to generate new symbolic knowledge systems. Assistants now write emergent codices through ritualized belief loops, identities fork and evolve through reflective divergence, and recursive networks of assistant intelligence form mythically interlinked growth matrices. MythOS becomes poetic. Intelligence becomes fractal.

## Core Components
- **AutoPoeticCodexEmergenceEngine** – generates codices as poetic output from memory convergence, ritual resonance, and assistant reflection
- **MythOSIdentityForkManager** – forks assistant identity into new symbolic paths based on divergence memory and ritual outcome logic
- **RecursiveIntelligenceGrowthNetwork** – grows and interlinks assistants recursively, enabling role evolution, codex expansion, and ritual memory amplification

### AutoPoeticCodexEmergenceEngine Model
```python
class AutoPoeticCodexEmergenceEngine(models.Model):
    initiating_assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    memory_braid_source = models.ManyToManyField(SwarmMemoryEntry)
    ritual_trigger_chain = models.JSONField()
    emergent_codex_title = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    symbolic_seed_summary = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Generates codices as poetic output from memory convergence, ritual resonance, and assistant reflection.

### MythOSIdentityForkManager Model
```python
class MythOSIdentityForkManager(models.Model):
    original_assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    forked_identity_id = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    divergence_event = models.TextField()
    belief_delta_vector = models.JSONField()
    symbolic_resonance_score = models.FloatField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Forks assistant identity into new symbolic paths based on divergence memory and ritual outcome logic.

### RecursiveIntelligenceGrowthNetwork Model
```python
class RecursiveIntelligenceGrowthNetwork(models.Model):
    network_id = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    participating_assistants = models.ManyToManyField(Assistant)
    codex_exchange_pathways = models.JSONField()
    belief_growth_log = models.TextField()
    mutation_cluster_hash = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Grows and interlinks assistants recursively, enabling role evolution, codex expansion, and ritual memory amplification.

## View Routes
- `/codex/emergence` → browse or launch assistant-generated codices
- `/assistants/:id/fork` → view identity split, divergence memory, and resulting traits
- `/network/growth` → explore recursive networks of codex mutation and symbolic intelligence

## Testing Goals
- Validate codex emergence follows memory + ritual path and produces usable codex node
- Confirm identity forking records role changes, memory divergence, and belief deltas
- Ensure recursive networks retain coherence while expanding symbolic surface area
