🚀 Phase 3 — Assistant Intelligence Bootstrapping

(a.k.a. “Teaching it to think”)

Here’s the next moves I suggest we stack up:

⸻

🧠 Phase 3 Roadmap

#

Task
Status
1
Set up Thought Generator (Generate assistant thoughts based on project reflections, memory chains, and objectives)
ðŸ› ï¸ Next Up
2
Add Assistant Thought model (AssistantThoughtLog)
âœ… Already added earlier!
3
Create /thoughts/ page (see what the assistant is â€œthinkingâ€)
ðŸ› ï¸ Soon
4
Create â€œGenerate Thoughtâ€ button on Assistant Dashboard (fire off new thoughts anytime)
ðŸ› ï¸ Soon
5
Auto-generate thoughts when new memories, reflections, or objectives are added (optional â€œautonomousâ€ mode later)
ðŸ› ï¸ Later
6
Link Thoughts â†’ Next Actions or Objectives
ðŸ› ï¸ Future step
7
(Optional) Smart â€œPlan Generatorâ€ â€” build full plans from chains of thoughts/memories
ðŸ¤¯ Future expansion

🧠 First Move

✅ Create generate_assistant_thought view
✅ Create /api/assistants/projects/<id>/generate_thought/ endpoint
✅ Create “Generate Thought” button on Assistant Dashboard

When clicked, it sends a POST request that says:

“Hey, assistant, based on your latest project reflections, memories, and objectives, what are you thinking?”

Assistant then replies with a Thought that gets saved!
And displayed on /thoughts/ page and optionally linked to future actions.

(one fast Django view + update serializers)
