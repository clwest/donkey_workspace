# Phase Ω.6.1 — Assistant Benchmark Lab, Memory Reflection Flow, Token Tracker & Retry Audit System

Phase Ω.6.1 builds on the task engine introduced in Ω.6.0. Each assistant task execution now generates structured logs, token usage summaries and optional reflection records. Failed or ambiguous runs can be retried with an audit trail.

## Core Components
- **AssistantTaskRunLog** – records each task run with the result text and success flag.
- **TokenUsageSummary** – stores prompt/completion token counts for a run.
- **TaskRetryAuditLog** – tracks why a task was retried and the output delta.
- **BenchmarkTaskReport** – aggregates run statistics for benchmarking.

## View Routes
- `/benchmark/lab` – leaderboard with task counts and token efficiency.
- `/assistants/:slug/tasks` – task history with reflection preview and retry option.

## Memory Reflection Flow
After a task completes the linked memory entry is summarized using `MemoryService.log_reflection`. The reflection can be saved to long‑term memory from the UI.

## Token Tracker & Retry Button
The Run Task panel shows input/output token counts and provides a retry button. Each retry is logged to `TaskRetryAuditLog` for later review.
