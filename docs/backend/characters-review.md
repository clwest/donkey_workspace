    1. üìã Purpose
           Defines a Celery task (`train_character_embedding`) that, given a `character_id`, will:


            * Mark the character‚Äôs training profile as ‚Äúpending‚Äù

            * Build the prompt (`full_prompt()`), generate its embedding via `generate_embedding`

            * Persist the raw embedding in the `Embedding` table

            * Update the `CharacterTrainingProfile` to ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù (or ‚Äúfailed‚Äù if no vector) and store the vector
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Uses `@shared_task(bind=True)` so the task can access its own `task_id` for tracking.

            * Local imports inside the function to avoid circular dependencies between the `characters` and `embeddings` apps.

            * Two‚Äêstep status update pattern: first set to ‚Äúpending,‚Äù then to the final ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù/‚Äúfailed,‚Äù making it easy to observe in-flight tasks.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * `vector = generate_embedding(text) or []` silently falls back to an empty Python list if embedding fails, conflating ‚Äúno embedding‚Äù (failure) with an empty vector rather
    than preserving `None`.

            * Storing an empty list into the `Embedding` model may violate schema expectations (e.g. pgvector may reject non‚Äênumeric or zero‚Äêlength vectors).

            * The first `update_or_create` and the second run as separate operations without a DB transaction; a failure halfway could leave the profile marked ‚Äúpending‚Äù or ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù
    with no embedding.

            * Exceptions during `Embedding.objects.create` are swallowed without logging, making debugging silent failures harder.

            * Hardcoded `content_type='characterprofile'` string‚Äîif model naming changes, you‚Äôd need to update this literal.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Change `vector = generate_embedding(text) or []` ‚Üí explicitly check `if vector is None: ...` so you can distinguish ‚Äúfailure‚Äù vs. a legitimate zero‚Äêvector case.

            * Wrap the two profile updates and embedding creation in a single atomic transaction (`@transaction.atomic`) to ensure consistency.

            * Catch and log exceptions around the embedding creation (e.g. `except Exception as e: logger.error(‚Ä¶)`) before proceeding to update status.

            * Externalize the `content_type` literal (e.g. via a constant or by introspecting `CharacterProfile._meta.model_name`).

            * Add type hints (`character_id: int ‚Üí Dict[str, Any]`) and expand the docstring to document return structure.

            * Add unit tests to cover both successful and failed embedding generation paths.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Reads from `characters.models.CharacterProfile` and writes to `CharacterTrainingProfile`. Schema changes in those models will break the task.

            * Calls `generate_embedding` (which may trigger DB writes via async embedding saves) and writes into `embeddings.models.Embedding`, so changes to embedding serialization or
    vector length expectations will cascade here.

            * Exposes the Celery task name for workers; renaming the module or task will require updates to any external triggers.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * **Success path**: mock `generate_embedding` to return a fixed vector, then assert that:
                 ‚Ä¢ An `Embedding` record is created with the correct `content_id` and vector length
                 ‚Ä¢ `CharacterTrainingProfile` ends with status ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù and stores the same vector
                 ‚Ä¢ The return dict has matching `vector_length` and `status`.

            * **Failure path**: mock `generate_embedding` to return `None` (or raise), then assert:
                 ‚Ä¢ No `Embedding` record is persisted (or an empty fallback as implemented)
                 ‚Ä¢ `CharacterTrainingProfile` ends with status ‚Äúfailed.‚Äù

            * **Error logging**: induce an exception in `Embedding.objects.create`, verify that it‚Äôs caught and logged, and that the profile still moves to ‚Äúfailed.‚Äù

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose
           Provides DRF API views for the `characters` app, including:


            * CRUD on `CharacterProfile`, `CharacterStyle`, and `CharacterReferenceImage` via ViewSets

            * Custom actions: scene image generation (`scene_edit`), reference‚Äêimage uploads (URL or file), automatic caption/alt‚Äêtext, and semantic tagging

            * List views for characters by project and images by character

            * Character name generation via OpenAI completion

            * Two flavors of similarity endpoints: free‚Äêtext ‚Üí top matching characters, and character-to-character similarity

            * Endpoints for viewing/tracking embedding training status and triggering Celery tasks
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Leverages DRF‚Äôs `ModelViewSet` and `@action` to keep most CRUD and custom endpoints concise.

            * Builds serializer context (`get_serializer_context`) so image URLs can be rendered with full absolute URIs.

            * Automatically enqueues background tasks (image generation, embedding training) without blocking the request.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * Duplicate imports and definitions: e.g. `CharacterProfile` and `status` are imported twice, and `CharactersByProjectView` is defined twice, leading to potential overrides or
     confusion.

            * Silent exception handling (`except Exception: pass`) in multiple places (theme enrichment, Celery enqueue, tag generation), which can mask bugs.

            * Hard-coded magic values (512√ó512 scene size, 50 steps, `engine_used='stable-diffusion'`).

            * Unimplemented TODO for `base_image_id` in `scene_edit`.

            * URL‚Äêbased image fetch uses `requests.get` with no timeout or size limit, which can hang or pull very large files.

            * Broad `AllowAny` on endpoints that may expose private character data or embed quotas without rate limiting.

            * Caching key in `CharacterSimilarityView` does not namespace by user, so different users‚Äô queries may collide.

            * Heavy logic in views (tag extraction, caption building, looping over all characters for similarity) that would be better extracted to service layers.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Remove duplicate imports; consolidate all DRF imports at top. Delete the second `CharactersByProjectView` to avoid name collisions.

            * Replace silent `except: pass` blocks with at least `logger.warning(...)` so failures are visible.

            * Externalize scene parameters (width, height, steps, engine) into settings or request fields with defaults.

            * Add timeouts (and optionally `stream=True`) when fetching remote images, and enforce a maximum file size.

            * Use DRF `Serializers` (or `@parser_classes` and `@validators`) to validate POST data (`prompt`, `style_id`, etc.) instead of manual `if not prompt` checks.

            * Scope `cache_key` in similarity views to `(user.id, fingerprint)` so results are private per user.

            * Extract complex logic‚Äîimage‚Äêtag generation, caption/alt_text building, similarity loops‚Äîinto dedicated service/helper functions to simplify view code.

            * Add type hints to view methods (`-> Response`) and docstrings for all custom endpoints.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Depends on `embeddings.helpers.helpers_processing` and `embeddings.models.Embedding` for similarity and embedding logic; changes there will break similarity endpoints.

            * Enqueues tasks in `images.tasks.process_sd_image_request` and `characters.tasks.train_character_embedding`, so renaming or changing those tasks affects these views.

            * Reads/writes `CharacterStyle`, `CharacterReferenceImage`, `CharacterTrainingProfile`, and `CharacterProfile`; any schema change will cascade here.

            * Uses OpenAI client directly (`client = OpenAI()`)‚Äîenvironmental changes to API keys or network policies will impact name generation.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * Unit-test `scene_edit`: supply valid/invalid prompts, theme IDs, style IDs, and assert correct DB creation and task enqueued (mock `process_sd_image_request`).

            * Test `CharacterReferenceImageViewSet.create` for both file uploads and URL inputs, including failure on unreachable URL, correct filename generation, and
    auto-caption/alt_text logic.

            * Validate the similarity endpoints (`CharacterSimilarityView` and `CharacterProfileSimilarityView`) by mocking `generate_embedding` and seeding a few `Embedding` records;
    check cache hits/misses and ranking order.

            * Assert that private‚Äêscoped endpoints respect `IsAuthenticated` and that `AllowAny` endpoints handle missing or malformed data with proper 400/500 responses.

            * Integration tests for name generation: mock the OpenAI client to return a controlled response and assert the view extracts and returns only the name.
