# 🧭 Post-RAG Roadmap: Evolving the Assistant System

Once all routes are connected and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is fully functional, the next phases should focus on transforming passive systems into adaptive, collaborative intelligence.

---

## 🧠 Phase 1: Assistant Memory + Planning UI

**Goal**: Turn passive memory logs into active planning tools.

### Features:
- Memory Review & Edit Panel to inspect and tweak memory entries manually.
- Assistant Roadmaps to maintain goals, tasks, and deadlines.
- Reflection Insights integrated into memory and project timelines.

**Why**: Provides long-term coherence and lets assistants evolve deliberately.

---

## 🧪 Phase 2: Skill Training & Evaluation System

**Goal**: Track, assign, and evolve assistant or agent capabilities.

### Features:
- Skill Profiles generated from memory and feedback.
- UI to assign training documents and tasks.
- Performance Logs showing evaluation metrics and growth.

**Why**: Enables adaptive learning and systematic skill refinement.

---

## 🕸 Phase 3: Agent Collaboration + Workflow Threads

**Goal**: Coordinate multiple assistants on shared projects.

### Features:
- Task Delegation and inter-assistant handoff.
- Narrative Thread Debug Views for visualizing collaboration.
- Delegation summaries and threaded memory integration.

**Why**: Unlocks true swarm intelligence through dynamic teamwork.

## 🌐 Bonus Opportunities

### MCP Toolchain Explorer
- UI for browsing available tools, API endpoints, document access, etc.

### Prompt Refinement Playground
- Remix, compare, and rate prompt variants interactively.

### Diagnostics Analytics Dashboard
- Track route usage, glossary hit/miss ratios, prompt effectiveness over time.

## ✅ Strategic Summary

These phases complete the transformation from:
- 🔧 *Hardcoded agents* → 🤖 *Context-aware thinkers*
- 📜 *Static prompts* → 🧠 *Dynamic memory-driven reasoning*
- 🧍 *Solo models* → 🕸 *Collaborative intelligent systems*
