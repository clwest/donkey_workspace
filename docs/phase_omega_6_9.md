# Phase Œ©.6.9 ‚Äî Auto-Ritual Triggering, Swarm Scoreboards & Deploy-Aware Reflection Assistants

Phase Œ©.6.9 adds the first layer of autonomous symbolic planning in MythOS. Assistants can self-trigger rituals based on memory or performance conditions, participate in a swarm scoreboard to track symbolic contribution, and reflect differently based on their deployment history.

## üîÅ Auto-Ritual Trigger Engine

**View Route**
- `/ritual/triggers`

**Features**
- Trigger assistant rituals from codex clauses, memory flags or performance tags
- List active triggers with symbolic tags and linked assistants
- Simulate trigger outcome and enable/disable per assistant or codex tag

**Backend**
- `RitualAutoTriggerRule`
- `RitualTriggerLog`

## üèÜ Swarm Execution Scoreboard

**View Route**
- `/swarm/scoreboard`

**Features**
- Display symbolic contribution metrics across agents
- Sort by reflections written, tasks executed or memory value delta
- Filter by swarm, role or archetype

**Backend**
- `SwarmSymbolicScore`
- `AssistantImpactTrace`

## üß† Deploy-Aware Reflection Assistants

**Endpoint**
- `/reflect-now/` now references the last deployment vector

**Features**
- Include task context and standard results in reflection prompt
- Adjust assistant memory weights after failed ritual outcome

**Backend**
- `DeploymentAwareReflection`

## ‚úÖ Dev Tasks
- Add `/ritual/triggers` and `/swarm/scoreboard` views
- Extend `/reflect-now/` to reference last deployment vector
- Add admin panel to create symbolic auto-trigger rules
