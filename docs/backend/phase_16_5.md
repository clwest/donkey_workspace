# Phase 16.5 — Guild-Specific Deployment Kits, Symbolic Cross-Network Assistant Transfers & Persistent Ritual Function Containers

Phase 16.5 enables portable symbolic deployment across the MythOS belief infrastructure. Guilds receive custom deployment kits, assistants can be moved between networks using symbolic transfer protocols, and rituals are encapsulated into function containers with state persistence and execution history.

## Core Components
- **GuildDeploymentKit** – defines a portable belief package configured for a specific guild.
- **AssistantNetworkTransferProtocol** – transfers assistants between symbolic environments with codex validation.
- **RitualFunctionContainer** – encapsulates ritual logic into persistent state containers with reproducible outcomes.

### GuildDeploymentKit Model
```python
class GuildDeploymentKit(models.Model):
    guild = models.ForeignKey(CodexLinkedGuild, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    included_codices = models.ManyToManyField(SwarmCodex)
    assistant_manifest = models.ManyToManyField(Assistant)
    symbolic_parameters = models.JSONField()
    deployment_notes = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Defines a portable belief package configured for a specific guild.

### AssistantNetworkTransferProtocol Model
```python
class AssistantNetworkTransferProtocol(models.Model):
    assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    source_network = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    target_network = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    symbolic_transfer_packet = models.JSONField()
    codex_compatibility_log = models.TextField()
    successful_transfer_flag = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Transfers assistants between symbolic environments, with codex validation and fallback handling.

### RitualFunctionContainer Model
```python
class RitualFunctionContainer(models.Model):
    ritual = models.ForeignKey(EncodedRitualBlueprint, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    execution_context = models.JSONField()
    symbolic_input_log = models.JSONField()
    result_trace = models.TextField()
    container_status = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Encapsulates ritual logic into persistent state containers with reproducible outcomes.

## View Routes
- `/deploy/kits` – build, export, and assign symbolic guild deployment bundles.
- `/assistants/:id/transfer` – manage symbolic network transfer process.
- `/ritual/containers` – inspect persistent ritual states and replay execution history.

## Testing Goals
- Validate deployment kits include valid assistants, codices, and symbolic parameters.
- Confirm assistant transfers preserve memory and codex compatibility flags.
- Ensure ritual containers persist state, input, and symbolic effect logs across sessions.
