This file documents the full review log from Phase Ω.BILL.2 of the LibertyLens system, used to analyze and refine legislative document embeddings and prepare downstream AI agents for accurate legal reasoning, transparency tooling, and civic Q&A.

## ✅ Detected Issues & Suggested Fixes

- Fragmented or context-poor summaries (e.g. placeholder phrases like “as provided in section X”).
- Secretary power delegation without qualifier, scope, or oversight.
- Use of undefined acronyms (e.g. MAGA accounts).
- Financial instruments or tax rules that could lead to confusion or misapplication without clarification.
- Inconsistent formatting or missing subsection references that prevent automated parsing or human review.
- Weak or missing local control checks on public land and zoning provisions.
