    codex
    1. üìã Purpose:
           Provides utilities for breaking text into manageable chunks for document embedding or summarization workflows. Functions include fixed-size chunking with overlap,
    sentence-aware splitting, fingerprint generation for deduplication, and summary truncation.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices:


            * Uses configurable constants (e.g. CHUNK_OVERLAP, MAX_CHUNKS_PER_DOCUMENT, MAX_SUMMARY_CHARS) to avoid magic numbers scattered through the code.

            * Optional dependency on NLTK with a sensible regex fallback, so the code remains functional even if NLTK is not installed.

            * Clear separation of concerns: distinct functions for chunking, fingerprinting, similarity, and summarization.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells:


            * Hardcoded thresholds (e.g. skipping chunks shorter than 50 characters) may not suit all domains and are not documented or configurable.

            * Two fingerprint functions (`generate_chunk_fingerprint` using MD5 over sampled words vs. `fingerprint` using SHA-256 over normalized text) may confuse future
    maintainers‚Äînaming overlap without clear distinction.

            * `fingerprint_similarity` performs character-level comparison on hex digests, which doesn‚Äôt necessarily correlate with semantic similarity and may be misleading.

            * The fallback sentence splitter (`re.split(r'(?<=[\.\!\?])\s+')`) can produce poor splits on abbreviations or numbered lists.

            * Lack of logging or warnings when truncation or chunk limits are applied (e.g. hitting MAX_CHUNKS_PER_DOCUMENT).
        4. üîß Suggestions:


            * Expose key thresholds (minimum chunk length, overlap ratio) as function parameters or settings rather than constants, so users can tune them.

            * Unify or better distinguish fingerprint functions (perhaps rename one to emphasize MD5 ‚Äúsampling‚Äù vs. SHA-256 ‚Äúfull‚Äù fingerprint).

            * Add type hints to all functions (e.g. return types are present but parameter types could be more explicit).

            * Improve docstrings with parameter descriptions, edge-case behavior, and mention of default constants.

            * Consider injecting a pluggable sentence tokenizer interface to avoid brittle regex fallback.

            * Introduce optional logging when content is dropped or truncated for greater transparency.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts:


            * Relies on NLTK (if installed) or regex fallback; changes here could affect any service that ingests NLTK‚Äôs sentence tokenizer.

            * Any change to chunking defaults will ripple through embedding storage and retrieval (e.g. vector indices relying on consistent chunk boundaries).

            * Fingerprint changes may invalidate existing deduplication records in databases or caches that use these hashes.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas:


            * Unit tests for `generate_chunks` covering: empty text, very short text, exactly threshold-length text, and enforcing overlap behavior.

            * Tests for `generate_chunk_fingerprint` and `fingerprint` to confirm idempotence and stability under text normalization.

            * `fingerprint_similarity` edge cases: identical hashes, completely different hashes, and unequal length inputs.

            * `split_text` with and without NLTK installed (mock `_has_nltk`) to ensure both code paths are exercised, including very long sentences.

            * `summarize_chunks` at boundary conditions (exactly MAX_SUMMARY_CHARS, just over, empty list).

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose:
           Provides Redis-backed caching utilities for storing and retrieving document embeddings and tracking which documents have been processed within a given session.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices:


            * Leverages Django‚Äôs `cache` framework and centralizes TTL values as module‚Äêlevel constants (`DOC_TTL`, `SESSION_TTL`).

            * Uses JSON serialization to keep stored data portable across cache backends.

            * Each public function has a clear docstring explaining its intent, inputs, and outputs.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells:


            * **Race condition** in `track_session_usage`: a read‚Äìmodify‚Äìwrite cycle can overwrite concurrent updates, potentially losing document IDs.

            * **Broad exception handling**: catching `Exception` hides specific errors and may mask bugs (e.g. serialization vs. connectivity issues).

            * **Hardcoded TTLs and key patterns** (`doc:{id}:embedding`, `session:{id}:docs`) aren‚Äôt configurable per‚Äêdeployment and could collide with other cache users.

            * **Potential data bloat**: unlimited growth of session doc lists with no cap or eviction strategy beyond TTL.
        4. üîß Suggestions:


            * Switch to Redis set operations (e.g. `cache.client.sadd`) or use `cache.add` with list-append semantics in a transaction/pipeline to avoid races.

            * Move TTLs and key prefixes into Django settings or allow overriding via optional function parameters.

            * Narrow exception catches to `CacheError` (or the appropriate backend exception) and handle JSON errors separately.

            * Add type hints on return values and parameter types (e.g. `-> Optional[List[float]]` is implicit but could be annotated).

            * Include docstrings for module-level constants and document the cache key namespace conventions.

            * Add validations/logging when session doc lists grow beyond a sane size, or enforce a maximum list length.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts:


            * Relies on the global `django.core.cache.cache` configuration; behavior varies by backend (memory, Redis, Memcached).

            * Uses the `'embeddings'` logger‚Äîany changes here might affect log filtering or monitoring dashboards.

            * Key naming could overlap with other services using `doc:` or `session:` prefixes in the same Redis instance.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas:


            * Unit‚Äêtest `cache_document_embedding`/`get_cached_embedding` with a dummy cache backend: verify correct JSON storage and retrieval, and TTL argument.

            * Simulate cache failures (e.g. mock `cache.set` to throw) to assert that errors are logged and callers don‚Äôt crash.

            * Test `track_session_usage` under concurrent scenarios (using threads or mocked pipelines) to ensure no lost updates.

            * Verify `get_session_docs` returns an empty list for missing keys, invalid JSON, and after session expiry in an integration test with a real Redis backend.

    thinking for 37s

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose:
           Provides I/O helpers for embeddings‚Äîgeneric cache get/set, persisting Embedding model instances via GenericForeignKey, stubs for queuing and chat‚Äêmemory workflows, and a
    generic similarity‚Äêsearch helper across any Django model.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices:


            * Centralized cache wrappers (`get_cache`/`set_cache`) with error logging to avoid uncaught cache‚Äêbackend failures.

            * Clear docstrings on most public functions describing intent and parameters.

            * Reuses Django‚Äôs ContentType framework to decouple embedding storage from specific models.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells:


            * Redundant imports (`Embedding` imported twice, unused `uuid` and `np` when not installed).

            * Bare `except Exception:` blocks swallow all errors‚Äîeven programming bugs or misconfigurations‚Äîmaking debugging harder.

            * Hardcoded cache timeout (3600 s) and key schemes without module constants or settings overrides.

            * Special‚Äêcase mapping of `"memoryentry"`‚Üí`"thought"` is a magic string hack with no context or comment.

            * Earlier drafts included placeholder helpers (`search_similar_embeddings`, `save_message`, `update_memory`, `retrieve_similar_messages`).
              These stubs have been removed to avoid accidental calls to unfinished code.

            * In `search_similar_embeddings_for_model`, inner‚Äêloop exceptions are silently dropped‚Äîmissing any logging of failures on individual objects.
        4. üîß Suggestions:


            * Remove duplicate and unused imports (`uuid`, redundant `Embedding`, conditional `np` import unless strictly needed).

            * Introduce module‚Äêlevel constants for default cache timeout and key prefixes, and allow overrides via Django settings or function parameters.

            * Replace broad exception catches with more specific (e.g. `CacheError`, `DatabaseError`) and separate JSON/serialization errors.

            * Externalize the `"memoryentry"`‚Üí`"thought"` mapping into a configuration or helper to avoid hard‚Äêcoding.

            * Fill in or delete unimplemented stubs to prevent runtime surprises; this has since been addressed by removing unused placeholder helpers.

            * Add type hints to all function signatures (e.g. return types on `set_cache`, `queue_for_processing`, etc.) and annotate the `model_class` parameter.

            * Enhance `search_similar_embeddings_for_model` to log inner‚Äêloop exceptions (at debug level) so faulty records don‚Äôt fail silently.

            * Expand docstrings to describe return values, raised exceptions, and behavior under edge cases (e.g. empty inputs).
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts:


            * Depends on the `embeddings.models.Embedding` schema; any field changes could break save/retrieve logic.

            * Relies on `compute_similarity` from `helpers_processing`‚Äîchanges in that metric will affect all similarity searches.

            * Uses Django‚Äôs `cache` alias‚Äîdifferences between Redis, Memcached, or locmem backends could alter serialization or eviction semantics.

            * ContentType lookups may add overhead or cache‚Äêthundering under heavy load if not cached themselves.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas:


            * Mock `cache.get`/`cache.set` to raise and verify that `get_cache` returns `None` and logs errors, while `set_cache` does not propagate exceptions.

            * Unit‚Äêtest `save_embedding` with a fake model instance: verify skip logic on empty/invalid lists, correct ContentType‚Äêbased `content_type_str`, and calls to
    `Embedding.objects.create`.

            * Test `retrieve_embeddings` handles both successful queries and simulated database exceptions.

            * For `search_similar_embeddings_for_model`, create a dummy in‚Äêmemory queryset (or mock `model_class.objects`) and a stubbed `compute_similarity` to verify sorting, `top_k`
    truncation, and optional `filters`.

            * Previous stubs have been removed, eliminating the need for `NotImplementedError` checks.

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose:
           This module encapsulates core embedding‚Äêprocessing utilities:


            * `retry_with_backoff`: generic retry wrapper with exponential backoff + jitter

            * `generate_embedding`: calls OpenAI‚Äôs embeddings API (v1 SDK)

            * `compute_similarity`: manual cosine‚Äêsimilarity fallback

            * `find_similar_characters`: brute‚Äêforce similarity lookup over a ‚ÄúCharacterTrainingProfile‚Äù queryset
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices:


            * Exponential backoff with jitter in `retry_with_backoff` reduces thundering herd on API errors.

            * Centralized OpenAI client instantiation (`client = OpenAI()`), avoiding repeated setup.

            * Thorough logging (warnings, errors with `exc_info=True`) gives visibility into failures at each step.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells:


            * PGVector import flag (`PGVECTOR_AVAILABLE`) is never actually used‚Äî`find_similar_characters` always falls back to manual compute, making the conditional dead code.

            * Broad `except Exception:` blocks swallow unexpected bugs and make root‚Äêcause debugging harder.

            * Inconsistent return types in `generate_embedding`: returns `None` for blank text, `[]` on error, and `List[float]` on success.

            * `find_similar_characters` loads all profiles into memory and does per‚Äêobject Python loops‚Äîunscalable if the table grows.

            * Hardcoded model name (`"text-embedding-3-small"`), status string (`status='complete'`), and lack of configurability for retry parameters or query filters.
        4. üîß Suggestions:


            * Actually leverage `CosineDistance` when `PGVECTOR_AVAILABLE` to push similarity computation into the database and avoid full table scans.

            * Narrow exception catches: distinguish API errors, network timeouts, and programming exceptions; let non‚Äêtransient errors bubble up.

            * Unify the return contract of `generate_embedding` (e.g. always return `Optional[List[float]]`, using `None` for failures).

            * Externalize hardcoded defaults (model name, status filter) into module‚Äêlevel constants or Django settings.

            * Add full type hints on all functions (including return types), and expand docstrings to document raised exceptions, edge‚Äêcases, and expected behavior.

            * Consider an asynchronous variant of `retry_with_backoff` or allow pluggable sleep function for better integration in async contexts.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts:


            * Downstream modules (`helpers_io`, chunking, etc.) call into `compute_similarity`‚Äîany change to its API or behavior will ripple through all similarity‚Äêbased features.

            * The OpenAI client here is shared globally; modifications (e.g. to authentication or timeouts) will affect all embedding calls.

            * `find_similar_characters` imports `characters.models.CharacterTrainingProfile`: renaming or refactoring that model will break this function.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas:


            * Unit‚Äêtest `retry_with_backoff` by injecting a dummy function that fails a set number of times before succeeding, verify both success and final‚Äêfailure paths, and that delays
     roughly match exponential backoff.

            * Mock the OpenAI client to produce a well‚Äêformed response, a malformed response (missing `data` or `embedding`), and a raised exception, asserting `generate_embedding`
    returns the correct types (`List`, `None`, or `[]`) and logs appropriately.

            * Test `compute_similarity` on: identical vectors, orthogonal vectors (expect ~0), negative dot products (clamped to 0), zero‚Äêlength inputs, and mismatched lengths.

            * Stub `CharacterTrainingProfile.objects` with a small in‚Äêmemory list of objects that have an `.embedding` and `.character` attributes, verify `find_similar_characters`
    returns correctly sorted top_k and handles import failures gracefully.

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose:
           Centralize and deduplicate the download of NLTK data packages (e.g. ‚Äúpunkt‚Äù, ‚Äústopwords‚Äù, ‚Äúwords‚Äù) at runtime, ensuring that each package is only fetched once per process and
    avoiding redundant downloads.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices:


            * Uses a threading.Lock and an in-memory set (`_downloaded_packages`) to prevent concurrent or duplicate downloads within the same process.

            * Checks for existing data via `nltk.data.find` before invoking `nltk.download`, avoiding unnecessary network calls.

            * Clear, concise docstrings on the public API (`ensure_nltk_data`, `load_required_nltk_data`) and use of the standard `logging` module.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells:


            * The lookup path logic is brittle:      nltk.data.find(f"{'tokenizers' if package_name == 'punkt' else 'corpora' if package_name in ['stopwords','words'] else
    ''}/{package_name}")

                 ‚Äì packages outside those three will use an empty directory prefix (`"/<pkg>"`) and always trigger a download.

            * Global mutable state (`_downloaded_packages`) is per-process only; multiple worker processes (e.g. in Gunicorn) will each redownload the same packages.

            * The `os` import is unused.

            * Broad `except Exception:` around `nltk.download` may mask failures other than network errors.

            * No type hints on function signatures.

            * Hardcoded list of required packages inside `load_required_nltk_data` prevents easy extension or overrides via settings.
        4. üîß Suggestions:


            * Replace the inline conditional for data paths with a small mapping dict, e.g.      _NLTK_PATH_MAP = {
                       "punkt": "tokenizers",
                       "stopwords": "corpora",
                       "words": "corpora",
                       # extendable‚Ä¶
                     }

            * Remove the unused `import os`.

            * Add type hints:      def ensure_nltk_data(package_name: str) -> bool: ...
                     def load_required_nltk_data() -> bool: ...

            * Narrow exception handling around `nltk.download` to only catch expected network or I/O errors.

            * Allow the list of required packages to be injected (e.g. via Django settings or a function parameter) to support future expansion.

            * Document in the module docstring or README that this loader is process-local and should be invoked early in application startup.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts:


            * Any code that calls NLTK tokenizers or corpora (e.g. sentence splitting, stopword removal) must rely on this loader having been run first; missing calls will lead to
    `LookupError`.

            * Downstream modules (e.g. `chunking.py`‚Äôs fallback sent_tokenize) assume ‚Äúpunkt‚Äù is present once this loader succeeds.

            * Thread safety here only addresses in-process concurrency; external orchestrators with multiple processes will see repeated downloads.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas:


            * Mock `nltk.data.find` to succeed and verify that `ensure_nltk_data` returns `True` without calling `nltk.download`.

            * Mock `nltk.data.find` to raise `LookupError` and `nltk.download` to succeed, then confirm that the package is added to `_downloaded_packages`.

            * Simulate `nltk.download` throwing an unexpected exception and assert `ensure_nltk_data` returns `False` and logs an error.

            * Test `load_required_nltk_data` with a mix of successful and failing `ensure_nltk_data` calls (using monkeypatch) to ensure it returns the correct boolean and logs
    appropriately.

            * (Advanced) Spawn multiple threads all calling `ensure_nltk_data("punkt")` concurrently with `nltk.download` mocked to record invocations‚Äîassert only one download attempt

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose:
           Defines a centralized ‚Äúsearch_registry‚Äù mapping that associates string keys (e.g. ‚Äúprompt‚Äù, ‚Äúmemory‚Äù, ‚Äúthought‚Äù) with metadata for performing embedding-based searches over
    various Django models. Each entry describes:


            * A human-readable label

            * The Django model class

            * A queryset factory (lambda) to fetch only non-empty records

            * Which field holds the embedding

            * Which field contains the text to search

            * Which field is the unique identifier
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices:


            * Central registry pattern avoids scattering model/queryset logic throughout the codebase.

            * Each entry uses a lazy `lambda` for the queryset so the database hit is deferred until needed.

            * Consistent dict structure ensures uniform consumption by downstream search utilities.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells:


            * `compute_similarity` is imported but never used here, suggesting dead code or incomplete functionality.

            * Raw dicts lack type safety‚Äîno guarantee that every entry has all five required keys or that `queryset` really returns a QuerySet.

            * Hardcoded ‚Äúembedding_field‚Äù: many entries set it to `None`; callers may need to special-case these and potentially error at runtime.

            * Magic strings for registry keys (‚Äúprompt‚Äù, ‚Äúmemory‚Äù, etc.) with no centralized list of valid options; typos could lead to silent failures.

            * Repetition across entries (e.g. ‚Äúdescription‚Äù / `None`) hints at opportunity to reduce boilerplate.
        4. üîß Suggestions:


            * Encapsulate each registry entry in a small `@dataclass` or namedtuple (fields: `label`, `model`, `queryset_fn`, `embedding_field`, `text_field`, `id_field`) to get
    auto-generated `__init__`, type hints, and IDE support.

            * Define an explicit API for registry lookup (e.g. `get_search_config(key: str) -> SearchConfig`) that validates presence and raises a controlled exception if `key` is
    invalid.

            * Remove the unused `compute_similarity` import (or integrate similarity logic here if intended).

            * Consider moving `None` defaults for `embedding_field` into the dataclass constructor so callers can detect ‚Äúnot yet vectorized‚Äù more idiomatically.

            * Document the valid registry keys and expected usage in a module-level docstring.

            * Add type annotations to the registry (e.g. `Dict[str, SearchConfig]`) and lambdas (`Callable[[], QuerySet]`).
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts:


            * Downstream search functions (wherever `search_registry` is consumed) will break if model fields change (e.g. `Prompt.content` renamed) or if entries are removed/renamed.

            * Changing the `queryset` logic (e.g. adding filters) affects all consumers of that key; registry entries should be treated as part of the public API.

            * Any refactor of `search_registry` must coordinate with code that iterates over keys or dynamically builds menus based on it.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas:


            * Write a test that iterates over every `search_registry` key, invokes its `queryset()` lambda, and asserts:
                 ‚Ä¢ it returns a Django QuerySet
                 ‚Ä¢ the QuerySet‚Äôs model matches the declared `model`

            * Test that each registry entry has non-empty `label`, non-None `text_field`, and valid `id_field`.

            * Attempt lookups for invalid keys via a future `get_search_config` API and assert a descriptive exception is raised.

            * If you introduce a `SearchConfig` dataclass, test its construction and default values for `embedding_field=None`.

        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices:


            * Low temperature (0.2) for more deterministic outputs.

            * Clear prompt template showing expected format (`[‚Äúplanning‚Äù, ‚Äúreflection‚Äù, ‚Ä¶]`).

            * Simple exception handling around the parsing step to avoid propagating malformed outputs.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells:


            * **Unsafe eval**: using `eval()` on arbitrary LLM output can execute malicious code.

            * **Hardcoded model name** (‚Äúgpt-4o-mini‚Äù) and parameters (max_tokens, temperature) limit flexibility and make tuning difficult.

            * **No retry or backoff**: a single API call may transiently fail without retry logic.

            * **No logging**: failures in the try/except swallow errors silently, making debugging harder.

            * Replace `eval()` with `ast.literal_eval()` or parse JSON to safely extract the list.

            * Add logging inside the exception block to capture parse or API errors.

            * Parameterize the model name, temperature, and max_tokens via settings or function parameters for easier experimentation.

            * Wrap the API call in a retry‚Äêwith‚Äêbackoff helper to handle transient network/API errors.

            * Add a docstring on `generate_tags_for_memory` specifying the return type and failure behavior.

            * Add type hints for return (`-> List[str]`) and ideally enforce that all tags are lowercase strings.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts:


            * Relies on the version and behavior of the `openai` Python client; upgrading major versions may break the `.chat.completions.create` signature.

            * If the registry or queueing logic elsewhere expects tags in a different format (e.g. JSON), callers may need adjustments.

            * Any change to this function (e.g. moving to a JSON-based parser) may require retraining or revalidating downstream consumers of tags.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas:


            * Mock `client.chat.completions.create` to return a well‚Äêformed Python‚Äêlist string, a JSON‚Äêstyle list, and malformed outputs‚Äîassert correct parsing or fallback to `[]`.

            * Simulate an API exception and verify that it propagates (or returns `[]` if you choose to catch it) and that logging occurs.

            * Test that the function respects `max_tags` by including more tags in the LLM response than allowed and trimming the result accordingly (if enforcing).

            * Verify that using `ast.literal_eval` rejects non‚Äêlist outputs (e.g. dicts, strings) rather than silently accepting them.

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose:
           Implements a generic circuit-breaker pattern to wrap arbitrary callables and prevent repeatedly invoking a failing service. Provides in-process tracking of failure counts,
    automatic state transitions (CLOSED‚ÜíOPEN‚ÜíHALF-OPEN‚ÜíCLOSED), and a decorator (`circuit_protected`) with optional fallback behavior.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices:


            * Uses an `Enum` (`CircuitState`) for clear, self-documented circuit states.

            * Thread-safe registry and state mutations via an `RLock`, avoiding race conditions in multi-threaded contexts.

            * Decorator pattern cleanly separates protection logic from business code, with support for a user-supplied fallback.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells:


            * The `success_threshold` (hard-coded to 2) isn‚Äôt configurable, but influences HALF-OPEN‚ÜíCLOSED transitions.

            * Uses a single class-level `_lock` for both registry and instance state, which can serialize all state changes across breakers and degrade performance.

            * `allow_request` in HALF-OPEN allows unlimited calls‚Äîeven failing ones‚Äîpotentially skewing the success count.

            * Emoji characters in log messages (üîå) may not be desired in all logging contexts.

            * Broad `except Exception:` in the decorator wrapper treats any exception (even non-service errors) as a circuit failure.

            * No way to reset or remove breakers once registered, which could leak memory in long-running processes.
        4. üîß Suggestions:


            * Make `success_threshold` a constructor parameter or class constant so callers can tune recovery sensitivity.

            * Split the registry lock from per-instance locks: give each `CircuitBreaker` its own `self._lock` to reduce global contention.

            * In HALF-OPEN, consider limiting allowed calls or immediately transitioning on the first failure rather than counting successes only.

            * Add full type hints on public methods and decorator signature (including `fallback: Optional[Callable[..., Any]]`).

            * Replace blanket `except Exception:` in the wrapper with more targeted catches (e.g. network errors) so user code bugs don‚Äôt trip the circuit.

            * Expose a health-check method (e.g. `status()` returning state and counters) and an explicit `reset()` API for operational control or testing.

            * Remove or parameterize emojis in logs, and include circuit name/context in a structured log field rather than inlined text.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts:


            * Any function decorated with `@circuit_protected` will now raise `CircuitOpenError` (or call the fallback), so callers must handle that exception or provide a fallback.

            * Global registry (`CircuitBreaker._registry`) persists breakers by name; name collisions across modules could cause unintended shared state.

            * Logging uses the root ‚Äúdjango‚Äù logger‚Äîcould interfere with existing logging configurations or filters.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas:


            * Unit tests for state transitions:
                 ‚Ä¢ 5 consecutive failures ‚Üí OPEN, immediate blocking ‚Üí HALF-OPEN after `reset_timeout`, 2 successes ‚Üí CLOSED.
                 ‚Ä¢ Failure during HALF-OPEN immediately reopens the circuit.

            * Verify that `allow_request` respects timeouts (simulate time advance).

            * Test the decorator behavior:
                 ‚Ä¢ Without fallback: open circuit raises `CircuitOpenError`.
                 ‚Ä¢ With fallback: returns fallback value and does not call the wrapped function.

            * Multi-threaded test to fire failures and successes concurrently and assert no race conditions or deadlocks.

            * Test registry operations: `get_or_create` returns the same instance for repeated names, and new breakers use configured thresholds.

    thinking for 10s

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose
           This module defines a simple post-processing step for embedding search results: it filters out low-similarity matches, sorts the remainder by similarity (descending), and caps
    the number of returned items.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Clear, centralized constants (`MIN_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`, `MAX_RESULTS`) with explanatory comments, making it easy to adjust behavior.

            * A concise, well-scoped function that does one thing (filtering + sorting) and returns the result cleanly.

            * Provides a docstring for `filter_similar_results`, describing inputs and outputs.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * The hardcoded constants may need to be overridden per environment or use-case; embedding these directly can reduce flexibility.

            * The parameter `results` is assumed to be a list of `(id, similarity_score)` tuples; there‚Äôs no validation or error handling if the tuple structure is invalid.

            * Logging at INFO level on every call can become noisy in high-volume contexts.

            * Using the name `id` shadows Python‚Äôs built-in; it‚Äôs minor but could lead to confusion.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Consider injecting `threshold` and `max_results` as function parameters (with defaults) or loading them from Django settings for greater configurability.

            * Add type hints (`List[Tuple[UUID, float]] -> List[Tuple[UUID, float]]`) to make the API contract explicit.

            * Introduce basic input validation (e.g., ensure each item is a two-element iterable with a numeric similarity).

            * Swap out or lower the logging level (e.g., DEBUG) if this runs very frequently.

            * Increase documentation around when/where this function is called and how its thresholds should be tuned.

            * Add unit tests covering edge cases (empty inputs, all below threshold, ties at the cutoff, etc.).
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Relies on Django‚Äôs logging configuration (`logger = logging.getLogger("django")`).

            * Likely invoked by the embeddings/search or fine-tuning workflow elsewhere; changing its signature or behavior could affect any downstream code that expects exactly `(id,
    score)` tuples or uses the default thresholds.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * Unit test with `[]` ‚Üí `[]`.

            * Test with all similarities below `MIN_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` ‚Üí `[]`.

            * Test a mixed list to verify correct filtering, sorting order, and that `MAX_RESULTS` is enforced.

            * Boundary test: items exactly at the threshold are included.

            * Invalid inputs (e.g., wrong tuple shape) should either raise a clear error or be documented as unsupported.

    thinking for 62s

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose
           This module centralizes embedding-related utilities for the Django app:


            * Generating, caching, normalizing, and resizing text embeddings (via a sentence-transformer) with retry and circuit-breaker logic

            * Saving and asynchronously persisting embeddings to DB (`save_embedding`, `async_save_embedding`, `save_message`)

            * Retrieving and searching embeddings (`retrieve_embeddings`, `search_similar_embeddings`)

            * A few helpers (unique ID generator, cache wrappers, legacy similarity compute)
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Clear separation of concerns: generation, caching, DB persistence, retrieval/search each live in their own functions.

            * Robust error handling and observability: decorators for error-tracking, circuit breaker with fallback, structured log tags/extras.

            * Use of lazy imports (`_get_preprocess_text`, etc.) and local imports inside functions to avoid circular dependencies.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * **Dead or incomplete code** (now cleaned up):
                 ‚Ä¢ Earlier versions had a `retrieve_similar_messages` stub that returned `None`.
                 ‚Ä¢ `update_memory` had commented-out persistence logic.

            * **Hardcoded values**:
                 ‚Ä¢ Fiscal year ‚Äú2024‚Äù in `save_embedding` fallback path for document IDs.
                 ‚Ä¢ Max text length (8000 chars) in `save_message` is magic.

            * **Unused imports**: `L2Distance`, `re`, `json`, `importlib`, `asyncio` are never used.

            * **Helper ordering**: `get_cache` / `set_cache` are defined at the bottom yet used earlier in `generate_embedding`.

            * **Shadowing built-ins & type hints**: IDs and generic `Any` types, and many functions lack type annotations.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Remove or implement the stubbed functions (`retrieve_similar_messages`, `update_memory`) to avoid silent no-ops. This recommendation has been fulfilled by deleting the unused stubs.

            * Extract config (8000-char limit, fiscal year) into settings or function parameters.

            * Prune unused imports and group cache helper definitions near their first use.

            * Add type hints consistently (e.g. return types for `save_message`, `update_memory`).

            * Consider splitting this large file into smaller modules (generation, persistence, search).

            * Move to `cache.get()` / `cache.set()` directly or centralize cache helpers at the top.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Relies on `chatbots.models.ChatMessage` and `Topic`, `documents.models.Document`, and the `Embedding` model.

            * Uses `vector_utils` and `sentence_transformer_service` for core functionality‚Äîchanges here ripple to any embedding consumer.

            * Logging and error tracking ties into `utils.error_reporting` and Django‚Äôs `settings` + cache backend.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * Unit-test `generate_embedding` for: empty input, non-string input, retry logic (mock transformer errors), dimension mismatch (pad/truncate), cache hit vs miss.

            * Test `save_message` to ensure `ChatMessage` creation and that `async_save_embedding` is invoked for user messages only.

            * Test `save_embedding` for both `chat_message` and `document` paths, including invalid UUID fallback.

            * Test `retrieve_embeddings` with valid/invalid `session_id`.

            * Test `search_similar_embeddings` for text vs vector inputs, invalid shapes, and correct invocation of `filter_similar_results`.

            * Add integration tests that spin up a test DB, insert embeddings, and validate end-to-end search behavior.

    1. üìã Purpose
           Provides an ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù embedding service on top of your sentence‚Äêtransformer stack, offering:


            * Cache‚Äêfirst lookup with 24h TTL

            * Batched (and background) API calls to reduce latency

            * Deduplication of very similar texts via hashing

            * Tiered ‚Äúdefault‚Äù vs ‚Äúhigh‚Äêquality‚Äù models

            * Stats & cleanup hooks
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Clear separation of concerns: BatchProcessor handles threading/queuing, the service class orchestrates cache/API/queue logic.

            * Cache‚Äêfirst pattern with simple MD5‚Äêbased cache keys ensures idempotent lookups.

            * Fingerprint‚Äêbased deduplication to avoid re‚Äêencoding trivially similar inputs.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * **Parameter mismatch**: In `process_queue`, code calls `self.get_embedding(text, model=model)` but `get_embedding()` doesn‚Äôt accept a `model` kwarg‚Äîthis will raise a
    `TypeError`.

            * **Dead/stubbed logic**:
                 ‚Ä¢ `find_similar_texts` never returns any text because `_get_text_from_cache_metadata` always returns `None`.
                 ‚Ä¢ Imported `save_embedding` and JSON, lru_cache, datetime/timedelta are unused.

            * **Thread‚Äêsafety**: `fingerprint_map`, `embedding_queue`, and counters (`processed_count`, etc.) are mutated from both main and background threads without locks.

            * **Hardcoded ‚Äúmagic‚Äù constants** (MIN_TEXT_LENGTH=10, SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.92, BATCH_SIZE, MODEL names) are not configurable via Django settings.

            * **Unbounded growth**: `fingerprint_map` never prunes, potentially leaking memory on long‚Äêrunning processes.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Fix `process_queue` to route the model choice correctly (e.g. pass `high_quality` flag or extend signature).

            * Remove or implement `find_similar_texts` stub‚Äîstore original text in a side‚Äêmap or in cache metadata so retrieval works.

            * Introduce threading locks (e.g. `threading.Lock`) around shared state mutations.

            * Pull constants into `django.conf.settings` or allow overrides in the service constructor.

            * Prune old fingerprints (e.g. time‚Äêbased eviction) to avoid infinite growth.

            * Remove unused imports (`json`, `lru_cache`, `datetime`, etc.) and the unused `save_embedding` import.

            * Add type hints on all public methods and fill in missing docstrings (e.g. `_queue_for_processing`, `process_queue`).
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Relies on `embeddings.vector_utils` (normalize, preprocess, cosine_similarity) and `embeddings.sentence_transformer_service`.

            * Uses Django‚Äôs `cache` and `timezone`‚Äîcache backend config directly affects behavior.

            * Exposed via `get_optimized_embedding` and `queue_for_embedding`, so any consumer of those helpers will inherit bugs (e.g. broken `process_queue`).
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * Unit-test `get_embedding` for: cache hit vs miss, `force_refresh`, `wait_for_result=False` (enqueues only), exception in transformer.

            * Test `BatchProcessor` end-to-end: enqueue a mix of single and multi-item batches, verify callback results.

            * Test `process_queue` in non-background mode: populate `embedding_queue`, invoke `process_queue`, assert cache writes and fingerprint_map updates.

            * Validate `find_similar_texts` after implementing real metadata storage‚Äîensure it returns close matches above threshold and omits others.

            * Concurrency test: simulate parallel `get_embedding` and background flushes to assert no races on shared maps/counters.

    thinking for 37s

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose
           Provides a thread-safe singleton wrapper around a SentenceTransformer model, augmenting it with a learnable projection layer so its native embeddings are resized to 1536
    dimensions (OpenAI-compatible). Consumers call `get_sentence_transformer().encode(‚Ä¶)` or the convenience `encode_text(s)` APIs.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Thread-safe singleton: uses a class-level lock in `__new__`/`__init__` to ensure the heavy model loads only once.

            * Modular projection: clean use of `sentence_transformers.models` to insert a dense projection layer (with non-linear activation) to unify embedding dimensionality.

            * Sensible defaults on encode: batches of 8, normalized outputs, and no progress bar give consistent, efficient inference settings.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * The `model_name` parameter is only honored on the very first instantiation. Subsequent calls to `get_sentence_transformer(another_model)` silently return the original
    instance, which can confuse callers.

            * Base model name (`BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`) and output dim (1536) are hard-coded‚Äîno override via Django settings or environment.

            * No device configuration for CUDA vs CPU vs MPS beyond an MPS-only flag; users on GPU may want explicit `device_map` or `torch.device` control.

            * Lack of type hints on public methods makes integration trickier to IDEs or static checkers.

            * Logging the entire model architecture at INFO level may be overly verbose in production.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Allow callers to request different base models or dims (e.g. via Django settings), or document that only the first call‚Äôs `model_name` sticks.

            * Surface device selection (CUDA/CPU) via a constructor flag or env var, and pass to the transformer.

            * Add method or parameter to forcibly reinitialize the singleton if a different model is desired.

            * Introduce type annotations (`-> np.ndarray`, `text: str`, etc.) and tighten docstrings to match signature.

            * Lower verbosity of model repr log or guard it behind a DEBUG flag.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Downstream embedding code (e.g. in `embeddings/helpers.py`) uses this service‚Äîany change here (API, dims, model) ripples into all embedding generation paths.

            * Relies on `sentence_transformers` and `torch`; library upgrades (verson mismatches) could break projection layer wiring.

            * Environment logic for `TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM` may interact with other parts of the app that spawn tokenizers in parallel.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * Verify singleton behavior: two calls to `get_sentence_transformer(‚Ä¶)` yield the same object, with the first call‚Äôs model name.

            * Mock a bad model name to simulate load failure and assert `__class__._initialized` remains `False` and errors are logged.

            * Test `encode` on single string and list inputs: assert output shapes are `(1536,)` and `(n,1536)` respectively.

            * On an embedding dimension mismatch (e.g. stub model that returns wrong size), confirm the warning is emitted but original array is returned.

            * Test on a Mac (MPS available) vs a Linux GPU/CPU environment to ensure device selection logic behaves as intended.

            * Lazy imports (`ensure_nltk_data`) and modular NLTK initialization to guarantee required corpora are loaded at runtime.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * **Single File, Many Responsibilities**: Mixing text preprocessing, vector math, DB queries, content‚Äêretrieval, enhanced ranking, and MMR in one module makes it hard to
    navigate and test.

            * **Hardcoded Constants & Magic Numbers**: Defaults for similarity thresholds, boost weights, MMR lambdas, NLTK stop‚Äêword language, etc., are embedded here rather than
    configurable via settings.

            * **Silent Failure Modes**: `cosine_similarity` catches all exceptions and returns `0.0`, potentially masking upstream errors.

            * **Inefficient DB Access**:
                 ‚Ä¢ In `enhanced_vector_search`, per‚Äêresult calls to `Document.objects.get` and `get_content_metadata` inside loops produce N+1 query patterns.
                 ‚Ä¢ `apply_maximum_marginal_relevance` does an `Embedding.objects.get` for each pairwise similarity check‚Äîpotentially hundreds of queries.

            * **Unused Imports**: `VectorCache`, `settings`, and `connection` are imported but never used.

            * **Circular‚Äêimport Risks**: Functions reference `embeddings.models`, `chatbots.models`, and `documents.models` inside bodies‚Äîthis can lead to import loops if not managed

            * Extract all ‚Äútunable‚Äù parameters (thresholds, boost weights, batch sizes) into Django settings with sensible defaults.

            * Replace silent excepts in `cosine_similarity` with either re‚Äêraises or at least a logged warning and `None`, so consumers know something went wrong.

            * Batch‚Äêfetch related models (documents, embeddings) up‚Äêfront to avoid N+1 queries; or cache metadata/embeddings in memory when reranking.

            * Remove unused imports and add type hints (`-> np.ndarray`, `List[Dict[str,Any]]`, etc.) across all public functions.

            * Add caching (in‚Äêmemory or Redis) for `get_content_metadata` if it‚Äôs called repeatedly on the same IDs.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Relies on the `Embedding` model in `embeddings.models` and on `chatbots.models.ChatMessage` and `documents.models.Document`. Changes to those schemas (field names, types)
    will break this code.

            * Uses `pgvector` for distance annotation‚Äîrequires your database to have that extension installed and configured.

            * NLTK preprocessing requires that the host environment allow downloading or bundling the `punkt` and `stopwords` corpora.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * **Unit tests for preprocessing**: verify that punctuation is stripped, stop‚Äêwords removed, and stemming works on representative English sentences.

            * **normalize_vector tests**:
                 ‚Ä¢ Input list vs. array vs. scalar vs. `None` vs. NaNs.
                 ‚Ä¢ Padding and truncation behavior when dims ‚â† `EMBEDDING_LENGTH`.

            * **cosine_similarity**: orthogonal vectors ‚Üí ~0, identical ‚Üí ~1, zero‚Äêvector input raises or returns defined behavior.

            * **vector_search**: mock a few `Embedding` rows (via Django‚Äôs TestCase fixtures) and assert correct filtering by content_type/session_id, correct ordering, and threshold
    behavior.

            * **enhanced_vector_search & MMR**: supply a small in‚Äêmemory set of embeddings with known timestamps and fake engagement data, then assert that recency/reliability/engagement
    factors influence ranking as expected and that diversity is introduced by MMR.

            * **Performance/regression tests**: measure query counts for reranking steps to ensure no unbounded N+1 patterns creep back in.

    Verify Embeddings Script

    ... (162 more lines)

    thinking for 18s

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose
           A standalone CLI script that boots Django, loads the custom SentenceTransformer service and helper functions, and runs three smoke‚Äêtests to verify:
           ‚Ä¢ Embedding dimensions (batch and helper paths) match the expected `EMBEDDING_LENGTH`
           ‚Ä¢ Embeddings are correctly normalized to unit L2 norm
           ‚Ä¢ Cosine similarity places semantically related sentences above an unrelated control
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Reuses existing code paths (`get_sentence_transformer`, `generate_embedding`, `normalize_vector`, `cosine_similarity`) to smoke‚Äêtest both core and helper APIs.

            * Provides clear, descriptive log messages and assertion error messages for quick debugging.

            * Uses batch encoding in `verify_dimensions` to confirm that multi‚Äêtext inputs work as intended.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * Reliance on bare `assert` statements: these can be stripped out under `python -O`, silencing failures in production test runs.

            * Hardcoded `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = "server.settings"` and manual `sys.path` hack‚Äîbrittle if project layout or name changes.

            * No explicit exception handling around `transformer.encode` or `generate_embedding`‚Äîif the circuit breaker is open or model fails, a `None` or exception will surface
    unpredictably.

            * Fixed test inputs and thresholds: e.g. similarity check only compares two sentences and makes no absolute threshold assertion, so if the model‚Äôs embedding distribution
    shifts, this may intermittently fail.

            * No command‚Äêline flags or configurability; users cannot, for instance, point at a different settings module or adjust verbosity.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Convert into a Django management command (`manage.py verify_embeddings`) to leverage Django‚Äôs settings loading and logging config, removing manual `sys.path` and
    `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` hacks.

            * Replace `assert` statements with explicit checks that raise `RuntimeError` (or custom exception) so failures are unambiguous regardless of interpreter optimizations.

            * Add command‚Äêline arguments (via `argparse`) or Django command options to override test sentences, batch sizes, or expected dimensions.

            * Wrap each verification step in its own try/except to provide per‚Äêtest pass/fail results, rather than aborting at first failure.

            * Add type hints on the three `verify_*` functions (`-> np.ndarray`, `-> float`, etc.) and update the module docstring to mention required environment variables or settings.

            * Expand coverage: test single‚Äêsentence batching, cache hits vs misses for `generate_embedding`, and that re‚Äêinvoking the helper uses the cached result when appropriate.
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Directly depends on `embeddings.sentence_transformer_service`, `embeddings.helpers.generate_embedding`, and `embeddings.vector_utils`. Any API changes there will break this
    script.

            * Uses the `EMBEDDING_LENGTH` constant from `embeddings.models`; changing that value will automatically update the expected shape in tests.

            * Relies on an active database connection indirectly via `generate_embedding` (which may perform DB writes via async save), so running this script also touches the DB.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * Add automated CI step that runs this script (or management command) and asserts exit code `0`.

            * Unit‚Äêtest each `verify_*` function by mocking `get_sentence_transformer().encode` to return controlled arrays (wrong shapes, zero vectors, random noise) and confirm errors
    are thrown.

            * Simulate a circuit‚Äêbreaker open state by mocking `generate_embedding` to return `None`, then verify `verify_dimensions` reports a clear failure.

            * Parametrize similarity tests with multiple pairs and thresholds (e.g., ensure `cosine_similarity(x,x)=1.0`).

            * Measure encoding latency under controlled load to detect performance regressions over time.

    codex
    1. üìã Purpose
           Defines a suite of DRF API endpoints around your embedding pipeline:


            * Generating embeddings from arbitrary text (`embed_text`, `embed_text_api`)

            * Chunking large documents into fingerprinted pieces (`chunk_text_api`)

            * Retrieving and placeholder‚Äìscoring stored embeddings (`search_similar_embeddings_api`)

            * Session document listing and usage tracking (`session_docs_api`, `track_session_api`)

            * Character similarity lookup (`search_similar_characters`)

            * Two flavors of generic ‚Äúsearch embeddings‚Äù endpoints‚Äîone driving a hardcoded `MODEL_LOOKUP` and one driving a configurable `search_registry`‚Äîplus a ‚Äúlist targets‚Äù endpoint.
        2. ‚úÖ Good Practices


            * Uses DRF‚Äôs `@api_view` and `@permission_classes` to expose clear REST‚Äêstyle handlers.

            * Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON error messages on bad input or internal failures.

            * Delegates heavy lifting (chunking, embedding generation, similarity search) to helper modules, keeping each view function quite small.
        3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns or Smells


            * **Duplicate function names**: `search_embeddings` is defined twice back‚Äêto‚Äêback; the second definition will override the first, making the first unreachable.

            * **Incorrect function call** in `embed_text_api`: it calls `embed_text(text)` although `embed_text` expects a `request` and returns a `Response`, not a raw embedding array.

            * **Placeholder logic** in `search_similar_embeddings_api` (`"score": 1.0`)‚Äîthe real similarity isn‚Äôt being calculated.

            * **Unvalidated inputs**: e.g. `content_ids` is used directly, but its expected type (list of IDs, single ID?) is not enforced.

            * **Hard‚Äêcoded configuration**: the `MODEL_LOOKUP` dict embeds model classes and field names directly; adding new model types requires code changes here.

            * **Overly permissive endpoints**: most views allow `AllowAny` with no throttling or authentication, which may expose embedding quotas or private data.
        4. üîß Suggestions


            * Remove or rename one of the `search_embeddings` functions; consolidate into a single endpoint or split into clearly named methods (e.g. `search_by_model_type` vs.
    `search_by_registry`).

            * Fix `embed_text_api` to invoke the underlying embedding helper (`generate_embedding`) directly and return its numeric vector, rather than calling the view helper.

            * Replace the `"score": 1.0` stub with a real similarity call (e.g. `compute_similarity`).

            * Use DRF `Serializers` (or `@api_view` + `@parser_classes`) to validate and coerce inputs (`content_ids` list, `session_id` UUID, `top_n` integer).

            * Externalize `MODEL_LOOKUP` (and any `search_registry`) into a settings‚Äêdriven registry, so new search targets can be configured without editing views.

            * Lock down permissions or add simple token‚Äêbased throttling on embedding endpoints to avoid abuse.

            * Add docstrings/type hints to every view function, and unify JSON response formats (e.g. always `{ data: ‚Ä¶ }` vs. ad-hoc).
        5. üîó Cross-App Impacts


            * Depends on `embeddings.helpers.helpers_processing`, `embeddings.helpers.helpers_io`, `embeddings.document_services`, and the `search_registry`‚Äîany changes there cascade to
    these endpoints.

            * Directly references `prompts.models.Prompt`, `mcp_core.models.MemoryContext`, and `assistants.models.AssistantThoughtLog`; adding/removing those models or changing their
    fields will break the `MODEL_LOOKUP` endpoint.

            * Exposes internal embedding/service behavior to external clients‚Äîmisconfiguration could impact your embedding quota or database load.
        6. üß™ Testing Ideas


            * Unit-test each endpoint for missing/invalid input (e.g. omit `text`, pass non-UUID `session_id`) and assert correct 400/500 responses.

            * Test `embed_text_api` and `embed_text` to ensure valid text returns a vector of correct length and type.

            * Integration test for `chunk_text_api`: feed a long passage, assert non-overlapping chunks and matching fingerprints.

            * For `search_similar_embeddings_api`, set up a few embeddings in the test DB, then call and assert real similarity scores replace the 1.0 placeholder.

            * Test both versions of `search_embeddings` (once with `model_type` from `MODEL_LOOKUP` and once with `target` from `search_registry`), verifying that only the correct fields
    are returned and that name collisions have been resolved.

            * Add a smoke test to ensure no two endpoints share the same URL pattern or view name, avoiding silent overrides.
