# Phase 14.3 — Ritual Loop Visualization Engines, Symbolic Oscillation Feedback Maps & Assistant-Driven Codex Re-Stabilization Nodes

Phase 14.3 expands MythOS with real-time visual tracking of ritual cycles and belief oscillations. Assistants can now log codex re-stabilization attempts after entropy spikes.

## Core Components
- **RitualLoopVisualizationEngine** – renders glyph cycles of ritual performance history, frequency trails, and convergence points.
- **SymbolicOscillationMap** – charts belief drift waveforms with codex strain and role pressure feedback.
- **CodexRestabilizationNode** – logs assistant-guided actions to restore codex alignment.

### CodexRestabilizationNode Model
```python
class CodexRestabilizationNode(models.Model):
    assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    codex = models.ForeignKey(SwarmCodex, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    symbolic_disruption_score = models.FloatField()
    stabilizing_action = models.TextField()
    restoration_tags = models.JSONField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

## View Routes
- `/ritual/loops` – view recurring ritual patterns and glyph maps.
- `/oscillation/map` – visualize belief swings and codex pressure.
- `/codex/stabilize` – record assistant-driven codex realignments.

## Testing Goals
- Validate ritual loop visualizations map history correctly.
- Confirm oscillation maps show entropy and symbolic tension.
- Ensure restabilization nodes log actions and tags.
