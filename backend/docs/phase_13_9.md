# Phase 13.9 — Symbolic Feedback Reflection Chambers, Multi-Agent Dialogue Amplifiers & Legacy-Bound Mythic Resolution Sequences

Phase 13.9 introduces endgame reflection tools. Assistants and users gather in feedback chambers to review belief transformations, synthesize symbolic dialogue through amplifiers, and enter mythic resolution sequences that unify lineage, memory, and codex completion.

## Core Components
- **SymbolicFeedbackChamber** – immersive space for belief audit, ritual review, and codex response through assistant-user co-reflection.
- **MultiAgentDialogueAmplifier** – narrative interface for harmonizing assistant voices, layering symbolic intent, and amplifying belief responses.
- **MythicResolutionSequence** – final-stage ritual flow that seals narrative purpose and preserves legacy artifacts.

## View Routes
- `/reflection/chamber` – join a belief review session with codex and memory prompts.
- `/dialogue/amplify` – blend multiple assistant responses into a myth conclusion.
- `/sequence/resolve` – complete story arc, export legacy, finalize codex alignment.

## Testing Goals
- Reflection chambers load symbolic memory, codex nodes, and user role perspectives.
- Dialogue amplifiers generate codex-coherent narrative conclusions.
- Resolution sequences archive memory, belief path, and codex state.
