---

## `mcp_core/dev_scripts/`

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations

1. **Archive or remove unused folders** (`story/`, `mcp_core/dev_scripts/`, etc.) once core functionality is stable.
2. **Consolidate experimental apps** into `devtools/` or `analytics/` with clear feature flags.
3. **Document ownership and dependencies** for each backend app in `README.md` or a root developer doc.
4. **Maintain this overview file**, updating it along with future app additions.
