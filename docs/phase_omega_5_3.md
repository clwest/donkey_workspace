# Phase Ω.5.3 — Assistant Chain Planner, Belief Resonance Forecast Panel & Long-Term Memory Refactor Engine

Phase Ω.5.3 enables MythOS to coordinate assistants in sequential chains, forecast their belief alignment over time, and restructure their long-term memory to reduce symbolic drift.

## Core Components
- **AssistantExecutionChain** – sequences assistants, prompts and tool handoffs.
- **ChainNodeMap** – maps each step in the execution chain with handoff rules.
- **BeliefForecastSnapshot** – stores predicted belief alignment shifts.
- **CodexResonanceIndex** – measures codex vs assistant resonance over time.
- **MemoryEntropyAudit** – detects entropy clusters in memory logs.
- **MemoryMergeSuggestion** – proposes merges or ritual cleanup for memories.

## View Routes
- `/plan/chains` – interactive execution chain planner.
- `/forecast/belief` – belief resonance heatmap dashboard.
- `/memory/refactor/:assistantId` – long-term memory refactor engine panel.

## Testing Goals
- Ensure execution chains save step mappings and handoff criteria.
- Validate forecast snapshots store alignment and drift metrics.
- Confirm memory audits tag entropy clusters and create merge suggestions.
