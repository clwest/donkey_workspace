# üß† Memory System: Temporal Event Types and Narrative Threading

This document captures the key concepts, event types, and design decisions related to building a narrative-aware assistant capable of linking sessions, tracking emotional milestones, and reconstructing its own thought journey.

---

## üî• High-Priority Temporal / Journey-Based Event Types

These should be flagged and saved for assistant reflection, dashboard analytics, and long-term narrative building:

### üß† Cognitive Milestones

- `insight`: Aha moments or breakthroughs
- `realization`: New awareness or reframing of an idea
- `question`: Complex or open-ended inquiry (esp. those that lead to forks)
- `decision`: Finalized choices after deliberation

### üí¨ Emotional / Vulnerable Moments

- `confession`: User reveals internal conflict, doubt, or past mistakes
- `emotion`: High affect moments (joy, anxiety, nostalgia, etc.)
- `frustration`: "I'm about to give up" or "this is pointless" messages

### üß≠ Strategic Turning Points

- `pivot`: We changed direction on a feature or approach
- `priority_shift`: A new goal or motivation overtakes previous ones
- `naming`: A concept gets a name or identity (e.g. Prompt Engine, DonkGPT)

### ‚è±Ô∏è Temporal Anchors

- `start`: First message in a new session or topic
- `callback`: Returning to a previous idea/thread after a delay
- `completion`: Finalization or launch of a feature/workflow

---

## üßµ Narrative Threading (Long-Form Context Linking)

To combat lost ideas across sessions, we‚Äôll introduce `NarrativeThread`:

```python
class NarrativeThread(models.Model):
    id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### Thread Attachments:

- `AssistantThoughtLog.thread` (FK)
- `MemoryEntry.thread` (FK)
- Future: `Session.thread`, `Project.thread`, etc.

### Assistant Capabilities:

- Suggest new threads based on topic drift or semantic clustering
- Auto-tag thoughts to threads with similarity search
- Summarize entire threads into blog posts, changelogs, or assistant memory capsules

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

- [ ] Create `NarrativeThread` model + admin
- [ ] Add `thread` FK to `MemoryEntry` and `AssistantThoughtLog`
- [ ] Build manual thread picker in frontend ThoughtCard/MemoryDetail
- [ ] Add thread summary serializer
- [ ] Optional: LLM-powered topic clustering and inference

This .md file can be safely tracked in Git and updated during future work sessions to serve as our memory core for the assistant‚Äôs narrative reasoning system.
