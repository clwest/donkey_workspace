# Phase 15.6 — MythOS Ritual Market Feeds, Multi-Agent Trend Reactivity Models & Symbolic Infrastructure Stability Graphs

Phase 15.6 gives MythOS its real-time symbolic economic feedback layer. Rituals stream as market data, assistants adjust behavior through trend reactivity models, and symbolic infrastructure gains monitoring via stability graphs.

## Core Components
- **RitualMarketFeed** – represents ritual performance frequency, symbolic value and belief market conditions.
- **MultiAgentTrendReactivityModel** – models how groups of assistants shift behavior in response to ritual and codex trends.
- **SymbolicStabilityGraph** – monitors codex mutation frequency, ritual echo intensity and memory volatility to forecast system health.

### RitualMarketFeed Model
```python
class RitualMarketFeed(models.Model):
    ritual = models.ForeignKey(EncodedRitualBlueprint, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    symbolic_price = models.FloatField()
    execution_count = models.IntegerField()
    belief_sentiment_index = models.FloatField()
    entropy_pressure_score = models.FloatField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Represents ritual performance frequency, symbolic value and belief market conditions.

### MultiAgentTrendReactivityModel
```python
class MultiAgentTrendReactivityModel(models.Model):
    agent_group = models.JSONField()
    input_signal_vector = models.JSONField()
    codex_pressure_adaptation = models.JSONField()
    ritual_reaction_map = models.JSONField()
    symbolic_resonance_stability = models.FloatField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Models how assistant groups shift behavior according to ritual and codex trends.

### SymbolicStabilityGraph Component
Inputs: codex mutation frequency, ritual echo intensity, memory volatility index. Outputs: symbolic infrastructure health and forecasts for role drift, codex burnout and ritual overload.
```python
class SymbolicStabilityGraph(models.Model):
    codex_mutation_frequency = models.FloatField()
    ritual_echo_intensity = models.FloatField()
    memory_volatility_index = models.FloatField()
    infrastructure_health = models.FloatField()
    risk_forecasts = models.JSONField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Tracks overall symbolic infrastructure health.

## View Routes
- `/market/rituals` – live symbolic ritual market dashboard
- `/assistants/trend-reactivity` – view agent group behavior vs belief signal
- `/system/stability` – monitor codex/ritual/memory system health

## Testing Goals
- Confirm ritual market reflects performance metrics, belief pressure and price logic.
- Validate trend reactivity updates assistant behavior models and codex responses.
- Ensure stability graph reflects stress points and visualizes system-level risk factors.
