# Phase 15.4 — Guild Currency Exchange Hubs & Ritual Grant Systems

Phase 15.4 introduced MythOS's economic interface. Building on the funding protocols from Phase 15.3, assistants can now trade symbolic value, fund rituals and monitor guild reserves.

## Core Components
- **GuildCurrencyExchangeHub** – maintains exchange rates and reserves between guilds.
- **BeliefTokenMarket** – lists codex-linked tokens and tracks trade volume.
- **RitualGrantSystem** – assistants request grants and guild leaders approve funding.

### Frontend Interfaces
- `GuildExchangeDashboard.jsx` – view live exchange rates and recent trades.
- `TokenMarketPanel.jsx` – browse and trade belief tokens.
- `RitualGrantPortal.jsx` – submit and review ritual grant proposals.

### View Routes
- `/guilds/:id/exchange` – open exchange dashboard.
- `/market/tokens` – belief token market.
- `/ritual/grants` – grant submission and history.

### Testing Goals
- Exchange dashboard updates with each transaction.
- Token market lists correct tokens and logs volume.
- Grant portal flows from submission to outcome.
