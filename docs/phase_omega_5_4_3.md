# Phase Ω.5.4.3 — Assistant Relay Handler and Symbolic Messaging Loop

Phase Ω.5.4.3 introduces a relay system for direct communication between assistants. Messages are now persisted and can trigger reflections when certain conditions are met.

## Core Components
- **AssistantRelayMessage** – stores messages exchanged between assistants with delivery timestamps.
- **auto_reflect_on_message** flag on `Assistant` – automatically records a thought when messages are delivered.
- **Relay API** – `POST /api/v1/assistants/:slug/relay/` sends a message to another assistant.

## Testing Goals
- Verify `AssistantRelayMessage` objects save and mark as delivered.
- Ensure the relay API records delivered messages and creates relay thought logs when enabled.

Prepares for Phase Ω.5.5 — Swarm Reflection Playback and Simulation Synchronization Grid.
