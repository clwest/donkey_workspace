# Phase Ω.5.5 — Swarm Reflection Playback, Prompt Cascade Watcher & Simulation Synchronization Grid

Phase Ω.5.5 empowers MythOS with reflective swarm review tools and synchronized simulation monitoring.

## Core Components
- **SwarmReflectionPlaybackLog** – stores playback timelines across multiple assistants.
- **SwarmReflectionThread** – groups related playback logs.
- **PromptCascadeLog** – traces how a prompt flows through agents and tools.
- **CascadeNodeLink** – links thought logs and tool events to a cascade.
- **SimulationClusterStatus** – tracks active simulation clusters.
- **SimulationGridNode** – represents an assistant within a simulation grid.

## View Routes
- `/swarm/playback` – timeline playback viewer.
- `/cascade/:promptId` – prompt cascade watcher.
- `/simulation/grid` – live simulation grid.

## Testing Goals
- Verify playback logs and threads save correctly.
- Ensure cascade logs create node links for reflections.
- Confirm simulation clusters list grid nodes with drift metrics.
