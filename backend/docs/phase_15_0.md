# Phase 15.0 — Codex Network Infrastructures, Swarm Logic Protocols & Multi-Agent Belief Optimization Engines

Phase 15.0 begins the final convergence arc of MythOS. Assistants operate as swarm components, codices interlink into modular logic nets and belief systems evolve through multi-agent optimization engines.

## Core Components
- **CodexNetworkTopologyMap** – visual and data structure showing inter-codex relationships, belief propagation paths and swarm state influence.
- **SwarmLogicProtocolRegistry** – codex-bound symbolic functions and assistant behaviors executable under ritual and memory conditions.
- **BeliefOptimizationEngine** – simulator that runs role, ritual, codex and memory cycles to optimize assistant belief structures.

### SwarmLogicProtocolRegistry Model
```python
class SwarmLogicProtocolRegistry(models.Model):
    protocol_name = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    execution_conditions = models.JSONField()
    codex_triggers = models.ManyToManyField(SwarmCodex)
    symbolic_routine = models.TextField()
    protocol_outcome_tags = models.JSONField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Ritual logic and codex contract execution patterns for symbolic automation.

### BeliefOptimizationEngine Model
```python
class BeliefOptimizationEngine(models.Model):
    assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    target_codex = models.ForeignKey(SwarmCodex, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    optimization_runs = models.JSONField()
    symbolic_efficiency_score = models.FloatField()
    convergence_vector = models.JSONField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Belief auto-tuning across directive, ritual, memory and codex feedback loops.

## View Routes
- `/codex/network` – explore inter-codex belief relationships.
- `/swarm/protocols` – manage ritual and codex-triggered assistant logic.
- `/assistants/:id/optimize` – simulate and refine an assistant's belief structure.

## Testing Goals
- Validate codex network topology shows correct symbolic relationship overlays.
- Ensure swarm logic protocols fire under defined memory or ritual conditions.
- Confirm belief optimization shows improvement or convergence across cycles.
