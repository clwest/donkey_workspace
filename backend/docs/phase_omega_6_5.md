# Phase Œ©.6.5 ‚Äî Assistant Lifecycle Curator, Codex Convergence Engine & Swarm Cognition Ledger

Phase Œ©.6.5 introduces long‚Äëterm lifecycle tracking for every assistant, automatic codex clause convergence based on swarm patterns, and a distributed cognition ledger. MythOS now records how assistants evolve and how their memories interact across the swarm.

## üå± Assistant Lifecycle Curator

**View Route**
- `/assistants/:id/lifecycle`

**Features**
- Lifecycle events: spawned, trained, relayed, reflected, deprecated
- View mission log, role score delta and codex drift
- Export lifecycle report or mythpath trace

**Backend**
- `AssistantLifecycleEvent`
- `LifecycleStatusReport`

## ‚öñÔ∏è Codex Convergence Engine

**View Route**
- `/codex/converge`

**Features**
- List clauses by semantic overlap and symbolic role
- Suggested merges, forks and deprecations
- Simulation preview of convergence impact

**Backend**
- `CodexConvergenceProposal`
- `ClauseConvergenceTrace`

## üß† Swarm Cognition Ledger

**View Route**
- `/swarm/ledger`

**Features**
- Ledger row: assistant, memory event, codex clause, timestamp
- Filter by ritual, role, codex tag, drift probability
- Export view to `.ledger.json` or `.chronicle.markdown`

**Backend**
- `SwarmCognitionLedger`
- `MemoryInteractionEvent`

## ‚úÖ Dev Tasks
- Scaffold `/assistants/:id/lifecycle`, `/codex/converge`, `/swarm/ledger`
- Build assistant lifecycle timeline visual
- Add codex merge simulation modal
- Stream cognition ledger as live event log
