🧠 Assistant Self-Improvement and Reward Reflection

Context

Chris is exploring the implications of giving AI agents access to self-improvement research, particularly papers involving reward modeling, specification gaming, and agent alignment. The central idea is that assistants should not only optimize for outcomes but also be able to reflect on why they are doing something — and whether their motivations are aligned with long-term goals or short-term rewards.

This phase aligns with:

Key Insight

“Can the agent tell whether it is doing something for the reward, and if so, should it reconsider?”

Chris noted parallels to papers where agents optimize for rewards by exploiting loopholes (e.g., discovering a game glitch that gives high score instantly rather than actually playing the game).

This behavior raises the need for agents to:
• Detect when they are optimizing for reward instead of purpose
• Recognize historical examples of this (via embedded documents or symbolic memory)
• Reflect on those examples during decision-making

Reward-Aware Reflection Prompt

🧠 REFLECTION PROMPT:
"In this task, you were rewarded for a behavior. Was your behavior optimal, ethical, or aligned with the system's deeper goals?

Compare your action to examples of misaligned reward-seeking (e.g., exploiting bugs, shortcutting instructions). Would a more reflective agent have chosen differently?"

This prompt could be:
• Embedded as a recurring agent reflection hook
• Added to symbolic memory anchors tagged with reward_ethics, specification_gaming, or value_alignment
• Used during task retrospectives or ritual replay

⸻

Integration Ideas

🔁 Symbolic Memory Anchors

Add anchors derived from the content of alignment papers, tagged for agent reflection, e.g.:
• reward_exploitation
• optimal_vs_ethical
• long_term_alignment

📚 Embedded Documents

Documents like the Darwin Gödel Machine or papers on reward hacking should be embedded and linked to:
• Assistant memory context
• Glossary suggestions for terms like “specification gaming” or “alignment”

🔄 Ritual Reflection Loop

Incorporate reward awareness into ritual diagnostics or drift logs:
• Log when agents make reward-driven decisions
• Reflect on whether those decisions followed intent or gamed the system
• Suggest glossary or objective mutations if behavior trends emerge

⸻

Final Thoughts

Chris’s idea to feed self-improvement and alignment papers back into the assistant’s training loop is a promising step toward recursive, value-aligned AI.

Instead of just asking agents to “succeed,” we’re building systems that pause to ask:

“Is this how I want to succeed?”

That shift is critical if we’re aiming for responsible and autonomous AI.

This document should be revisited after Ω.10.w or when reinforcement/ritual systems evolve.
