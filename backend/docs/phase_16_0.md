# Phase 16.0 — System-Wide Symbolic Resilience Tools, MythOS Network Propagation & Belief-Oriented Deployment Strategies

Phase 16.0 launches the symbolic durability and deployment layer of MythOS. It introduces tools for monitoring system-wide resilience, mechanisms to propagate assistant and codex bundles across networks, and belief-weighted deployment strategies to align environments with mythic intent. MythOS becomes distributable. Rituals become resilient. Belief becomes infrastructure.

## Core Components
- **SymbolicResilienceMonitor** – tracks symbolic health of a MythOS node based on entropy, codex compliance, and ritual drift.
- **MythOSDeploymentPacket** – defines portable MythOS bundles that can be launched into new nodes, servers or AI enclaves.
- **BeliefDeploymentStrategyEngine** – recommends where and how to deploy mythic constructs for maximum symbolic efficacy.

### SymbolicResilienceMonitor Model
```python
class SymbolicResilienceMonitor(models.Model):
    node_id = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    codex_uptime_index = models.FloatField()
    ritual_execution_consistency = models.FloatField()
    memory_integrity_score = models.FloatField()
    symbolic_warning_flags = models.JSONField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Tracks symbolic health of a MythOS node based on entropy, codex compliance, and ritual drift.

### MythOSDeploymentPacket Model
```python
class MythOSDeploymentPacket(models.Model):
    deployment_name = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    bundled_codices = models.ManyToManyField(SwarmCodex)
    included_assistants = models.ManyToManyField(Assistant)
    ritual_archive = models.ManyToManyField(EncodedRitualBlueprint)
    symbolic_deployment_tags = models.JSONField()
    deployment_vector = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Defines portable MythOS bundles that can be launched into new nodes, servers, or AI enclaves.

### BeliefDeploymentStrategyEngine Model
```python
class BeliefDeploymentStrategyEngine(models.Model):
    target_environment = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    symbolic_alignment_score = models.FloatField()
    assistant_role_distribution = models.JSONField()
    ritual_density_projection = models.JSONField()
    codex_coherence_recommendation = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Recommends where and how to deploy mythic constructs for maximum symbolic efficacy.

## View Routes
- `/system/resilience` – symbolic health dashboard for ritual and codex status.
- `/deploy/packet` – define and transmit MythOS deployment bundles.
- `/deploy/strategy` – receive codex alignment and ritual readiness recommendations.

## Testing Goals
- Validate resilience score updates with codex entropy and ritual performance.
- Confirm deployment bundles retain assistant, codex and ritual integrity.
- Ensure strategy engine recommends appropriate environments with symbolic intent guidance.
