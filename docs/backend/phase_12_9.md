# Phase 12.9 — Assistant-Guided Swarm Myth Replays, Legacy Lineage Threads & Ritual Preservation

Phase 12.9 preserves, replays, and evolves the myth. New models track cinematic replays, lineage handoffs, and ritual archives bound to codex epochs.

## Core Components
- **SwarmMythReplaySession** – assistant-narrated playback of key myth segments.
- **LegacyStoryThread** – chain of symbolic memory showing belief inheritance.
- **RitualPreservationLibrary** – versioned archive of ritual blueprints by epoch and codex.

## View Routes
- `/swarm/replay` – mythflow player for replay sessions.
- `/story/lineage` – visualize lineage threads across generations.
- `/library/rituals` – browse ritual archives.

## Testing Goals
- Replay sessions link assistants and codex tags.
- Story threads map belief shifts with codex links.
- Ritual libraries store blueprints with symbolic epochs.
