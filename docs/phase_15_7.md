# Phase 15.7 — Codex Mutation Arbitration Tools, Assistant Belief Arbitration Panels & Swarm-Wide Narrative Intervention Frameworks

Phase 15.7 introduces governance mechanisms for belief regulation. Codices that mutate too far, assistants that drift from alignment, and storylines at risk of divergence can now be reviewed through symbolic arbitration systems. MythOS develops checks and balances. Consensus is negotiated. Belief becomes accountable.

## Core Components
- **CodexMutationArbitrationTool** – framework for reviewing, resolving or reversing codex changes that destabilize belief coherence.
- **AssistantBeliefArbitrationPanel** – reflective assistant review flow for realigning misaligned symbolic roles.
- **NarrativeInterventionFramework** – triggers narrative repair when mutation entropy or ritual rejection rates exceed safe thresholds.

### CodexMutationArbitrationTool Model
```python
class CodexMutationArbitrationTool(models.Model):
    codex = models.ForeignKey(SwarmCodex, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    disputed_mutation = models.TextField()
    arbitration_panel = models.JSONField()
    symbolic_ruling = models.TextField()
    ritual_correction_suggested = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Framework for reviewing, resolving, or reversing codex changes that destabilize belief coherence.

### AssistantBeliefArbitrationPanel Model
```python
class AssistantBeliefArbitrationPanel(models.Model):
    assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    belief_drift_record = models.JSONField()
    codex_conflict_tags = models.JSONField()
    belief_review_outcome = models.TextField()
    memory_path_adjustment = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Reflective assistant review flow for realigning misaligned symbolic roles.

### NarrativeInterventionFramework Component
- **Triggers:**
  - Codex mutation entropy exceeds threshold
  - Ritual rejection frequency high
  - Role alignment pressure fractured
- **Actions:**
  - Schedule symbolic arbitration
  - Suggest codex rewind or memory patch
  - Display narrative fracture warning and assistant moderation flag

## View Routes
- `/codex/arbitration` – review, vote, and resolve codex mutation disputes
- `/assistants/:id/belief-panel` – evaluate assistant belief drift and suggest reflection
- `/intervention/queue` – monitor system-wide symbolic risk and propose narrative repair

## Testing Goals
- Validate mutation arbitration generates symbolic ruling with panel approval.
- Confirm belief panels update assistant directive alignment state.
- Ensure narrative intervention flows display fracture points and codex pressure recovery path.
