# 🧠 Phase Ω.8.4.a — Makefile Seeder Integration Patch

## 🧭 Objective

Update the project `Makefile` to fully support all existing seeder scripts, ensuring that after a fresh database reset, **all assistants, glossary anchors, dev docs, memory chains, reflections, and embeddings** can be reloaded in a single command.

---

## 🛠 Goals

### 🔹 1. Makefile Updates
- Add `make seed-all` to run:
  ```bash
  python manage.py seed_core_assistants
  python manage.py seed_glossary_terms
  python manage.py seed_documents
  python manage.py seed_chunks
  python manage.py seed_assistant_memory
  python manage.py seed_reflections
  python manage.py seed_rag_test_cases
  ```

- Optional:
  - Add `make flush-db` to run:
    ```bash
    python manage.py flush --no-input
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

### 🔹 2. Log Each Seeder
- Show:
  ```bash
  echo "✅ Seeded Core Assistants"
  ```

### 🔹 3. Optional: `make reset-seed`
- Drop, migrate, and reseed everything:
  ```bash
  make flush-db && make seed-all
  ```

## 🔧 Dev Tasks

### Backend
- [ ] Update `Makefile` with all known `seed_*.py` commands
- [ ] Validate that all management commands are registered in `backend/*/management/commands/`
- [ ] Ensure the order respects dependencies (e.g., assistants → projects → memories)

---

## 🧪 Verification

- [ ] Run `make flush-db`
- [ ] Run `make seed-all`
- [ ] Visit:
  - `/assistants/` → See all seeded
  - `/debug/rag-recall/` → Valid glossary matches
  - `/debug/route-check` → No blank routes

- Ω.8.2 — Document Assignment
- Ω.8.3 — Route Audit Panel
- Ω.8.1.e — Diagnostic Replay Logging

## 🧠 TL;DR:
> A myth without memory is a dream forgotten.  
> This Makefile binds the dream back into the assistant.
