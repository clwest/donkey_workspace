# Merged Markdown Corpus

This directory holds a flattened copy of all `*.md` files in the repository. It is generated by the Django management command `collect_markdown_docs` and serves as the unified knowledge base for assistant training.

## Usage

Run the command from the `backend` folder:

```bash
python manage.py collect_markdown_docs
```

Files are copied here with their original path converted to a single filename by replacing `/` with `__`.

### Options

- `--dry-run` – list what would be copied without writing files
- `--include-dotfiles` – include hidden markdown files such as `.README.md`
- `--overwrite` – replace existing files in this folder when hashes differ

Generated files are ignored by Git except for this README and `.gitignore`.
