# ✅ Narrative Thread Tracking — Progress Checkpoint

You’re actively building **Narrative Thread tracking** into your AI assistant project.  
This system ties together `MemoryEntry`, `AssistantThoughtLog`, and important themes via a new model: `NarrativeThread`.

---

## ✅ Backend Setup

- **Model:** `NarrativeThread` lives in `mcp_core.models`
- **Serializer:** `NarrativeThreadSerializer` includes:
  - `tags`
  - `created_by`
  - `origin_memory`
- **Views:** Split into modular files:
  - `views/threads.py`
  - `views/reflections.py`
  - etc.
- **API Routes:**
  - `GET /api/v1/mcp/threads/` → list all threads
  - `GET /api/v1/mcp/threads/<uuid:id>/` → thread detail
- **Helpers:** Thread auto-tagging and linking utilities under construction

---

## ✅ Frontend Setup

### Pages:

- `pages/mcp_core/threads/ThreadsOverviewPage.jsx`
- `pages/mcp_core/threads/ThreadDetailPage.jsx`

### Components:

- `components/mcp_core/TagFilterBar.jsx` (for tag filtering UI)
- ✅ Now working on: `ThreadCard.jsx`

---

## 📍 Next Steps

1. Finish building `ThreadCard.jsx` (reusable preview UI for each thread)
2. Drop it into `ThreadsOverviewPage.jsx` to render thread list
3. Wire up tag filtering using `TagFilterBar`
4. Then move on to wiring up the detail view (`ThreadDetailPage.jsx`)

🧵 Built for memory. Built for context. Built for clarity.
