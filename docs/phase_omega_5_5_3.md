# Phase Ω.5.5.3 — Execution Timeline Viewer, Retry Loop Visualizer & Swarm Dispatch Control Panel

Phase Ω.5.5.3 introduces a live symbolic task graph and centralized control hub for overseeing assistant execution, retry attempts, and dispatch routing. This phase gives MythOS its first visual timeline of swarm activity with interactive nodes to manage execution failures and dynamic task assignment.

## View Routes
- `/timeline/execution` – chronological view of execution events.
- `/dispatch` – command center to manage task routing and reruns.

## Features
- Timeline view of execution logs across agents with avatars and status colors.
- Hover and click interactions reveal task summaries, triggering agents, and links to logs.
- Retry loop overlay highlights failures and delay logic.
- Swarm dispatch panel assigns tasks to assistants and triggers replays or restarts.

## Backend
- **AssistantExecutionEvent** – records task, agent, ritual, status, and timestamps.
- **RetryLoopLog** – tracks failed operations and retry metadata.

Prepares for Phase Ω.5.6 — Codex Clause Mutator, Symbolic Fault Injection & Memory Alignment Sandbox.
