# Phase Ω.7.1.6 — Realtime Assistant Codex Interaction

This phase introduces experimental support for OpenAI's Realtime API. Assistants can now stream thoughts and reflections token by token. Core changes include:

- **Realtime WebSocket Client** – `stream_chat` in `assistants.helpers.realtime_helper` connects to `wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime` and logs `start`, `stop` and `edit` events via `PublicEventLog`.
- **Streaming Thoughts** – `CoreAssistant.think()` accepts `stream=True` and returns an async generator of tokens.
- **Streaming Reflections** – `MemoryService.log_reflection()` accepts an iterator of tokens which are concatenated before saving.
- **Frontend Hook** – `useRealtimeAssistant()` provides a simple wrapper for live typing and interrupt/edit controls.
- **UI Integration** – the stabilization campaign detail page and memory reflection page show live responses when streaming is active.

These updates pave the way for interactive clause reviews and real‑time assistant narration.
