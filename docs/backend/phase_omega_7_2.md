# Phase Ω.7.2 — Full Assistant Lifecycle MVP

Phase Ω.7.2 completes the first full end-to-end lifecycle for MythOS assistants. Starting from a YouTube link, the system can now ingest content, bootstrap a new assistant with a generated prompt, create a project and objective, plan tasks, and assign agents via reflection.

## ✅ Features Activated

- **Ingest YouTube → Create Assistant**
  - `POST /api/intel/ingest` with `source_type: "youtube"` ingests a video.
  - Then call `/api/intel/bootstrap-agent-from-docs/<document_id>/` to generate an assistant, prompt and project.
- **View Assistant & Projects**
  - `/api/assistants/` lists assistants. `/api/assistants/projects/` shows their linked projects.
- **Plan Tasks from Objective**
  - `POST /api/assistants/<slug>/objectives/<id>/plan-tasks/` uses `AssistantThoughtEngine.plan_tasks_from_objective()` to create tasks and log the plan.
- **Assign Agents via Reflection**
  - Reflection planning calls `AssistantReflectionEngine.plan_from_thread_context()` to assign agents with `AgentController.recommend_agent_for_task()` and create `AssistantNextAction` entries.

This phase forms the first complete symbolic feedback loop — assistants can be born from documents, generate a plan, and delegate tasks to agents automatically.
