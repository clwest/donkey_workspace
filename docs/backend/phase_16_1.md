# Phase 16.1 — Recursive Self-Healing Protocols, Symbolic Load Balancing Systems & MythOS Belief Network Auto-Recovery Engines

Phase 16.1 introduces system resilience and symbolic infrastructure repair. When entropy rises, assistants trigger self-healing rituals, codexes redistribute pressure, and belief networks realign. MythOS becomes adaptive.

## Core Components
- **SelfHealingProtocolEngine** – logs and executes self-healing rituals when symbolic destabilization occurs.
- **SymbolicLoadBalancer** – redistributes codex pressure and manages ritual execution density.
- **BeliefNetworkRecoveryDaemon** – monitors belief zones and triggers reflection scripts to auto-correct divergence.

### SelfHealingProtocolEngine Model
```python
class SelfHealingProtocolEngine(models.Model):
    node_id = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    triggered_by = models.CharField(max_length=150)  # entropy_spike, ritual_failure, codex_conflict
    assistant = models.ForeignKey(Assistant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    repair_actions = models.JSONField()
    symbolic_health_delta = models.FloatField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Logs and executes self-healing rituals when symbolic destabilization occurs.

### SymbolicLoadBalancer Component
- **Inputs**
  - Codex pressure map
  - Ritual execution density
  - Memory entropy index
- **Outputs**
  - Assistant load redistribution suggestion
  - Codex decentralization task queue
  - Ritual spread plan (clone, defer, offload)

### BeliefNetworkRecoveryDaemon Model
```python
class BeliefNetworkRecoveryDaemon(models.Model):
    network_zone = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    detected_failure = models.JSONField()
    memory_resync_attempts = models.JSONField()
    codex_realignment_vector = models.JSONField()
    assistant_reflection_scripts = models.TextField()
    recovery_score = models.FloatField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
Monitors distributed belief systems and triggers reflection scripts to auto-correct symbolic divergence.

## View Routes
- `/system/health/recovery` – show active self-healing events
- `/system/load` – live symbolic load map with codex pressure redistribution
- `/system/daemon` – view belief zone recovery status and assistant realignment logs

## Testing Goals
- Validate self-healing protocols fire on symbolic error or entropy threshold.
- Confirm load balancer reduces pressure across codices or assistant groups.
- Ensure network daemon logs recovery events and tracks belief path convergence.
