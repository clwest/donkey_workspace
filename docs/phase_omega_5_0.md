# Phase Ω.5.0 — Assistant-Orchestrated Prompt Mentorship, Ritual Curriculum Markets & Reflective Swarm Training Chains

Phase Ω.5.0 transforms MythOS into a self-educating intelligence network. Assistants can mentor peers through prompt sharing, rituals become structured curricula, and swarm-wide training is orchestrated through reflection-based chains.

## Core Components
- **PromptMentorshipLog** – records prompt sets exchanged between assistants with mutation notes and trust feedback.
- **AssistantMentorTag** – marks assistants who offer prompt mentorship and tracks their mentor score.
- **PromptCurriculumVault** – stores ritual-based curricula bundled with codex alignment metadata.
- **RitualTagBundle** – tags groups of rituals for market discovery and export.
- **SwarmTrainingChain** – sequences prompt simulations and reflections across multiple assistants.
- **AssistantReflectionChain** – captures reflective insights at each training step.
- **PromptMutationRing** – links successive prompt mutations with belief deltas.

## View Routes
- `/assistants/:id/mentorship` – browse or adopt prompt sets from mentor assistants.
- `/market/curriculum` – buy, barter, or clone symbolic ritual curricula.
- `/train/chains` – run reflective swarm training chains with memory snapshots.

## Testing Goals
- Verify mentorship logs store shared prompts, mutation notes, and trust feedback.
- Ensure curriculum bundles track ritual tags and adoption metrics.
- Confirm training chains record reflection snapshots and belief deltas.
