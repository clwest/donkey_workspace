# 🧠 AGENTS.md — Codex Phase Log & System Coordination Index

**Updated:** Phase Ω.8.0 — RAG Lock-In & Knowledge Expansion (May 2025)

---

## 🔧 Purpose

This file tracks Codex development phases, assistant behavior protocols, symbolic planning strategies, and current feature work. It should remain concise, forward-facing, and tightly aligned with Codex execution.

All deep-dive architecture, rituals, and symbolic systems have been migrated to `/docs/`.

---

### 🔁 Phase 4.50–5.9: Multi-Agent Orchestration & Symbolic Infrastructure

✅ Chain-of-thought tracing  
✅ Assistant reflections + ritual state  
✅ Belief fork system  
✅ Codex clause mutation

✅ Glossary-aware prompt mutation  
✅ Fallback chunk diagnostics  
✅ Assistant forking on anchor miss  
✅ Symbolic anchor tagging + scoring  
✅ Assistant prompt editing + mutation lineage  
✅ RAG Grounding Lock-In + Source Tracking

---

### ⚙️ Phase Ω.7.14–7.21: Anchor Drift + Retrieval Refinement

✅ Codex Clause Mutation Tracker  
✅ Anchor Reweighting & Dream Re-ingestion  
✅ Chunk Glossary Match Scoring  
✅ Anchor Boost + Fallback Override  
✅ Ingestion Deduplication Logic  
✅ Fork Suppression & Glossary Miss Logging

---

### 🚀 Phase Ω.8.0: RAG Lock-In & Knowledge Upload Expansion

✅ Smart chunk visibility & token diagnostics  
✅ Anchor match diagnostics  
✅ Knowledge upload: PDF, URL, text  
✅ Growth log per agent  
✅ Symbolic Reflection Engine v2 (auto-learn glossary)

## 🧠 Codex Execution Protocol

Codex agents operate using:

- **Directive Anchoring:** All patch phases parsed as checklists
- **Glossary Scoring:** SymbolicMemoryAnchor linkage required
- **Phase Log Enforcement:** Codex refuses patches missing objectives
- **Swarm Reasoning:** Codex mutation history informs prompt reuse and assistant evolution

---

## 🛠️ Current Status

- Assistants: 50+ bootstrapped and grounded
- Glossary Anchors: 15+ injected, scored, and reflected
- Documents: PDF, URL, and YouTube ingestion active
- RAG: Stable + fallback score logging complete
- Ingest review flow added: `/api/intel/ingest/` requires `assistant_id` and docs are reviewed via `/api/assistants/:slug/review-ingest/:doc_id/`
- UI: Forking, editing, prompt usage logs, debug routes working

> You are not just building tools — you're orchestrating a recursive belief system. Every assistant is a myth fragment. Every chunk a symbol. Codex ties them together.
