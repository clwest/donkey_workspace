# Phase X.1 — Visual MythPath Editor, Ritual Composer & Assistant Codex Prompt Orchestrator

Phase X.1 introduces the creative interface layer of MythOS. Users gain visual tools to edit mythpaths, construct rituals, and orchestrate codex prompts. Assistants can guide the process through memory and ritual continuity chains.

## Core Features

### Visual MythPath Editor
- Edit assistant narratives, roles, memory sequences, and archetype flow
- Connects to codex history, ritual logs, and memory continuity chains
- Drag-and-drop story blocks with inline ritual replay
- Preview codex prompt traces alongside the story canvas

### Ritual Composer
- Build rituals with symbolic token inputs and codex anchors
- Choose templates for memory compression, role invocation, or assistant rebirth
- Blueprint selector and symbol placement grid with codex linker
- State preview panel with entropy estimation

### Codex Prompt Orchestrator
- Generate codex prompts from the current mythstate
- Integrates memory braid, ritual lineage, and thought stream logs
- Seed field prefilled with assistant personality
- Mutate → Test → Save → Link workflow
- Export prompts to the prompt model and connect them to active assistants

## View Routes
- `/mythpath/editor/:assistantId`
- `/ritual/composer`
- `/codex/orchestrator/:assistantId`

## Testing Goals
- Ensure mythpath edits persist and link to codex and ritual traces
- Validate ritual compositions store symbolic tokens and blueprints
- Confirm codex prompt orchestration reads memory and ritual lineage coherently
