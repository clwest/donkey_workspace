# 🧠 AGENTS.md — MythOS Phase Summary & Architecture Index

**Last updated:** May 2025 (Post-Ω.7.13 RAG Core Finalization)

---

## 🌱 Phase 0–4: Core Assistant + Memory System Initialization

✅ Embedded memory, prompt logging, assistant thought engine, token reduction, Codex mutation pipeline.

---

## 🔁 Phase 4.50–4.95: Multi-Agent Orchestration & Swarm Reflection

✅ Chain-of-thought logging, assistant reflections, role inheritance, ritual modeling groundwork.

---

## ⚙️ Phase 4.96–5.9: Symbolic Infrastructure, Legacy Migration & Codex Genesis

✅ Codex mutation, clause mutator, belief forks, relay messaging, reflective planners, deployment standards.

---

## 🧠 Phase 6.0–7.9: Ritual Consensus, Symbolic Economy, and Myth Governance

✅ Ritual contracts, memory-layered planning, symbolic routing, glossary injection, and swarm reputation.

---

## 📡 Ω.7.0–Ω.7.13: Assistant Lifecycle, Document RAG, Glossary, and Prompt Evolution

### ✅ Ω.7.0–Ω.7.2 — Document-Based Assistant Bootstrapping

- Assistants built from YouTube, PDF, and URL docs with prompt generation, embedding, and project linking.

### ✅ Ω.7.2.c — Assistant Lifecycle Dashboard

- Dashboard showing assistant phase, current project, live thoughts, and prompt preview.

### ✅ Ω.7.2.f — RAG Memory Integration

- PGVector-based chunk retrieval with fallback detection and scoring enforcement.

### ✅ Ω.7.2.g — RAG Grounding Enforcement

- Response metadata shows RAG chunk usage with grounding badge.

### ✅ Ω.7.3 — Prompt Mutation & Lineage Forking

- Assistants forked with modified prompts when RAG misses glossary anchors or concepts.

### ✅ Ω.7.4a–c — System Cleanup and Patch Planning

- Orphaned endpoints removed, CRUD restored for prompt templates and assistant edits.

### ✅ Ω.7.5–Ω.7.6 — Glossary Injection & Mutation Loop Testing

- Symbolic glossary chunks injected during ingestion, anchor-aware scoring applied, fallback prompts mutated.

### ✅ Ω.7.7–Ω.7.8.b — Symbolic Anchor Framework

- `SymbolicMemoryAnchor` model created with linkbacks, inspections, reflection triggers, and glossary reinforcement.

### ✅ Ω.7.9.a–b — Smart Chunk Re-Ingestion and Glossary Anchor Seeding

- Manual chunk injection for concepts like “zk-rollup” and “EVM”, embedding and linkage inspection.

### ✅ Ω.7.10 — Anchor-Based Retrieval and Prompt Mutation Boosting

- Prompt responses now mutated and grounded based on symbolic anchor presence.

### ✅ Ω.7.11 — Assistant + Prompt Editing and Deletion

- Full edit/delete support added for assistants and prompts. Prevents redundant creation and supports lifecycle cleanup.

### ✅ Ω.7.12 — Route-Based Reload & Navigation Debugging

- Fixed stale state issues, force-refresh bugs, and frontend navigation reliability.

### ✅ Ω.7.13 — Core RAG Optimization & Source Grounding Lock-In

- Embedded chunk diagnostics complete; glossary terms required for critical concept grounding.

---

## 🛠️ In Progress

### 🔮 Ω.7.14 — Codex Clause Mutation Tracker & Symbolic Drift Visualizer

- Map clause lineage, detect prompt evolution trends, and highlight deviation from glossary/core anchors.

### ⚙️ Ω.7.15 — Anchor Relevance Reweighing & Dream Re-ingestion

- Re-score anchor-linked chunks dynamically based on assistant project evolution.

---

## ✅ System Status

- Assistants: 50+ bootstrapped and linked
- Documents: All types (PDF, YouTube, URL) supported
- Glossary Anchors: 15+ linked and tracked
- RAG Grounding: Fully active
- Reflection Loops: Triggered on glossary miss, document drift, and low score fallback
- UI: Fully supports assistant forking, prompt viewing, editing, and deletion

MythOS now enforces:

✔️ Grounded reasoning  
✔️ Symbolic memory linkage  
✔️ Prompt traceability  
✔️ Codex-driven assistant evolution
